/*
	There are two types of pool caches, one for doubles (d_list) and one
	for all allocations that are no more than MAX_CACHED_SIZE bytes (pool_map).
	Allocations larger than that are not cached.

	The cache is a set of free-block lists (FBL). Each FBL contains a list
	of memory allocations that have been 'released' and are all of the same size.
	To make the algorithm simplier and to save overheads, the sizes for each FBL
	are organized in a semi-logarithmic manner.	The FBL sizes start at RESOLUTION
	bytes, the next two are in increments of (RESOLUTION * 2^1),  the next two
	are in increments of (RESOLUTION * 2^2),  the next two are in increments of
	(RESOLUTION * 2^3), etc until the MAX_CACHED_SIZE is reached.

	For example, given that RESOLUTION is 8 and MAX_CACHED_SIZE is 1024 then
	there will be 14 free-block lists, with their allocation sizes of
	{8,16,24,32,48,64,96,128,192,256,384,512,768,1024} respectively.

	When an allocation is requested, and there is not one of that size availble
	in the cache, the requested size is rounded up to the next FBL size before
	a new allocation is made from the heap. For example, if an allocation of 80
	bytes is requested, the actual allocation will be for 96 bytes. This is so
	that when the block is later released, it can be added to the appropriate
	FBL so that any future request for bytes from 65-96 can be serviced from it.

	The pool_map is an array of pointers where each element points to a free-block
	list. Its purpose is to speed up the algorithm that determines which FBL to
	use for a given requested allocation size. As each FBL size is a multiple of
	RESOLUTION, the pool_map contains elements for each multiple of RESOLUTION
	up to MAX_CACHED_SIZE, and each element contains the address of the FBL
	appropriate for that size. For example, using the given values above, the
	pool_map will contain ((1024 / 8) + 1)= 129 entries. And the pool_map will
	look like ...

	   Pool_map[]         --->   Free Block List
	   -------------------------------------
	      Index   byte-range    Index alloc-size
	      [0]       0            (not used)
	      [1]      1-8    --->   [0]  8
	      [2]      9-16   --->   [1]  16
	      [3]     17-24   --->   [2]  24
	      [4]     25-32   --->   [3]  32
	      [5]     33-40   --->   [4]  48
	      [6]     41-48   --->   [4]  48
	      [7]     49-56   --->   [5]  64
	      [8]     57-64   --->   [5]  64
	      [9]     65-72   --->   [6]  96
	      [10]    73-80   --->   [6]  96
	      [11]    81-88   --->   [6]  96
	      [12]    89-96   --->   [6]  96
          ...
	      [126] 1001-1008 --->  [13]  1024
	      [127] 1009-1016 --->  [13]  1024
	      [128] 1017-1024 --->  [13]  1024

	The algorithm to calculate the index for the pool_map is ...

	     floor((RequestedSize + RESOLUTION - 1) / RESOLUTION)

	This pool_map entry at this index contains the address of the FBL to use for
	the requested size.

	When releasing a block, the block becomes the new 'first' item in the FBL,
	and it gets updated to point to the previous 'first' block.

	When trying to allocate a memory block, the first block in the FBL is used,
	and if not null, the FBL is updated to point to the next 'released' block.

	The cache for doubles is simplier because all doubles have the same size.

	Note, all allocations are at least 8 bytes long and aligned on an 8-byte
	boundary.  We need this because the address of the block is stored in the
	lower 29-bits of an 'object' and so when getting the real address from an
	'object', we shift the object's value to the left by 3. This is the same as
	stripping off the higher 3 bits and multiplying by 8.
