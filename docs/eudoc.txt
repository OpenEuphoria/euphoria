== eucdoc Documentation Tool
:<<LEVELTOC level=2 depth=4>>

Writing and managing documentation for your programs is made 
easier with the **##eudoc##** tool. ##eudoc##, written entirely in Euphoria, 
converts text comments embedded in your program, as well as information
about routines and identifiers, into documentation
that can be saved in a variety of formats, including plain text and HTML.

Since Euphoria comments do not slow down the 
execution of programs, documentation written inside source-code 
introduces no speed penalty but is very convenient.

##eudoc## can also incorporate documentation written externally from 
your source-code.

You write your material using //Creole// style markup to format documention.
This gives you creative control using elements like headers, fonts, 
cross-references, tables, etc. The **##creole##** program takes the
output  of ##eudoc## and produces HTML-formatted documentation.

A third party program like ##htmldoc## or ##wkhtmltopdf## may then be used to 
convert HTML to PDF. ##creole## will also output LaTeX files directly
that can be used to create professional PDF files for online viewing or
publishing.

=== Documentation Tags

Documentation is embedded in source-code using the Euphoria line 
//(// **--** //)// comments. Two special tags, {{{--**** }}} and 
{{{ --** }}} distinguish documentation from comments that will not be 
extracted.

=== Generic Documentation

"Generic" documentation starts with the //(// {{{ --**** }}} //)// tag, 
continues with lines starting with {{{ -- }}} in the first column, and 
ends with the next blank line. The tags and {{{--}}} will not appear in 
the documentation.

<eucode>
--****
-- generic text, thus tagged, will be extracted by eudoc
-- write your documentation here...
--

-- blank line is a terminator, this line is not included
</eucode> 
 
Produces...

{{{
generic text, thus tagged, will be extracted by eudoc
write your documentation here...

}}} 
 
 
=== Source Documentation 
 
"Source" documentation starts with the //(// {{{--**}}} //)// tag. 
Locate them before a routine or identifier that you wish to be described
in your documentation. The ##eudoc## program will extract the 
"signature" of a routine and combines it with the comments that you 
write after this tag. 

Starting with the source-code file ##favorite.ex##:

<eucode>
--**
-- this is my favorite routine

public procedure hello( sequence name )
   printf(1, "Hello %s!", {name} )
end procedure
</eucode>

Executing ##eui eudoc -o foo.txt favorite.ex## produces:

{{{
%%disallow={camelcase}

!!CONTEXT:favorite.ex

@[hello|]
==== hello
<eucode>
include favorite.ex
public procedure hello(sequence name)
</eucode>

  This is my favorite routine.
}}}

Process with ##eui creole foo.txt##:

<eucode>
include favorite.ex
public procedure hello(sequence name)
</eucode>

  This is my favorite routine.

If you examine the source-code included with Euphoria you will realize
how these steps were used to create the documentation you are reading 
now. 

=== Assembly File

Large projects are managed using an **assembly file**, which is a list 
of files (source-code, and external) that will be incorporated into one 
output file. Look at ##euphoria/docs/manual.af## for the file used to 
produce this documentation.

=== Creole Markup

Creole is a text markup language used in wikis, such as the 
[[http://openeuphoria.org/wiki/view/home.wc|Euphoria Wiki]], 
and for documenting source-code. 

* Common Creole tags are:

{{{
= Title

== Section

//italic// **bold** ##fixed##

* bullet
* lists are
* easy to produce


||  tables || are |
| easy to produce |  //with bold headers// |

<eucode>
-- euphoria code is colorized
for i=1 to 5 do	 
   ? i
end for
</eucode>
}}}

* The previous tags will produce html that looks like...

** Title ** \\
** Section ** 

//italic// **bold** ##fixed##

* bullet
* lists are
* easy to produce


||  tables        || are                   |
| easy to produce |  //with bold headers// |

<eucode>
-- euphoria code is colorized
for i=1 to 5 do	 
   ? i
end for
</eucode>

* More details can be found at the Euphoria Wiki under [[wiki:CreoleHelp|CreoleHelp]].

=== Documentation Software

The programs required for creating documentation are hosted on our
Mercurial SCM server at [[http://scm.openeuphoria.org]].

The program htmldoc is found at... http://www.htmldoc.org/ and http://htmldoc-binaries.org/.

For LaTeX on Windows, we suggest MiKTeX found at... http://miktex.org/
For those on Linux, you should be able to install via your package
manager.
