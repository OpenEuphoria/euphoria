== Version 3.0.2 February 9, 2007:
This release fixes some important bugs in 3.0.1, and improves the source code documentation.

=== Bug Fixes
<ul>
<li>
     **<font color="#009999">bug fixed: </font>**
     **Translator: **
     Programs translated to C and compiled for Windows 
     would crash if they used the new multitasking feature.
     (This worked in 3.0.0 but was broken accidentally in 3.0.1 
     because some stack offsets changed.)</li>
<li>
    
    **<font color="#009999">bug fixed: </font>**
     **Interpreter: **
    
    In fairly rare situations, the interpreter for Windows might crash.
    This was due to a bug in load_private_block() where it was freeing 
    a block of memory and then returning a pointer into that block. 
    In rare cases, a page of virtual memory might be removed from 
    the heap by the Windows O/S before the block could be read. 
    Thanks to Andy Serpa, 
    Pete Lomax, Matt Lewis, Derek Parnell, and others for helping to 
    pin-point the location of the bug.</li>
  
<li>

     **Source Code: **
    "\euphoria" was changed to to %EUDIR% in 4 .bat files in the
    source directory. Thanks to Jaime Marcos.</li>
    
</ul>

=== Improved Documentation
<ul>
<li>
A new document (translator.doc) was added to euphoria\source. It describes
the internals of the Translator, with emphasis on the many optimizations
that the Translator performs.</li>
<li>
    The user documentation was also improved in a few places.     </li>
</ul>

=== C Source Code Changes
<ul>
<li>
    Matthew Lewis added a Linux/FreeBSD make file, and made source code 
    changes to better support Open Watcom and a newer version of GCC.</li>
</ul>
