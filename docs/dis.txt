== EuDis, Disassembling Euphoria Code

<<LEVELTOC level=2 depth=3>>

=== Introduction

In the Euphoria source directory is a program named ##dis.ex##, which can be
used for parsing Euphoria code and outputting detailed disassembly
of the intermediate language (i.e., byte code) used by Euphoria, as well
as the symbol table.  The purpose of this tool is for low level debugging,
especially for developing Euphoria itself, or for understanding why 
certain code performs the way it does.

It uses the actual Euphoria front end to parse your code.  When Euphoria
is installed, there should be a shell script or batch file (depending on
your operating system) called ##eudis## or ##eudis.bat##, respectively, that can
be used to analyze your code:

{{{
$ eudis myapp.ex
saved to [/path/to/myapp.ex.dis]
}}}

When run, ##eudis## will say where its output was saved.  The file name, 
including extension, is used as the base for its output.  By default,
it outputs four files:

* ##.dis## The main disassembly file.  This shows the IL code representation
  both raw and symbolically.
* ##.sym## The symbol table.  This shows details for the entire symbol table
  for your code.
* ##.hash## Details about symbol hashing.
* ##.line## Line table information.  Unless tracing is enabled, this will be
  blank.
* ##.fwd## Counts, by name, of the number of forward references by symbol,
  along with the number of references by file.

=== HTML Output

##eudis## can output html documentation of your program somewhat similar to the
output from Doxygen.  This documentation is different than ##eudoc##.  It is 
meant to document the structure of your program, and to help developers 
understand code dependencies.  It can generate graphs showing how files include 
each other, as well as which routines call which others.  Note that generating 
graphs requires that you have [[http://www.graphviz.org|Graphviz]] installed.  
Note that generating call graphs can be quite time consuming for a large 
program.

By default, ##eudis## will create a subdirectory in the current directory called
##eudox##.  This may be changed using the ##--dir## option.

==== Command Line Switches

You can use the standard ##-i## and ##-c## switches with ##eudis##.  There are 
additional options:

* ##-b## parse the code as though it were being bound
* ##--dir <dir>## Specify the output directory for the html files
* ##-f## include a particular file in the html output
* ##--file-list## output the list of files included in the ##.dis## file at the 
top of the listing
* ##-g## suppress call graphs in html output
* ##--html## generate html documentation of your program
* ##--no-dep## Suppress dependencies.  Will not generate file and routine 
dependency graphs.
* ##--std## show standard library information, by default this is not shown
* ##-t## parse the code as though it were being translated
