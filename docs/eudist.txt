=== Introduction

EuDist is a tool that makes distributing your program easier.
It is designed to gather all of the Euphoria files that your program
uses and put them into a directory.  This can also be useful for
sending example code for bug reports.

You can use the standard ##-i## and ##-c## switches with ##eudist##.  There are 
additional options:

* ##~--clear## Clear the output directory before copying files
* ##-d <dir>## Specify the output directory for the files
* ##-e <file>## ##~--exclude-file <file>## Exclude a file from being copied
* ##-ed <dir>## ##~--exclude-directory <file>## Exclude a directory from being copied
* ##-edr <dir>## ##~--exclude-directory-recursively <file>## Exclude a directory
and all subdirectories from being copied
