== Version 3.0.1 November 3, 2006:
This release cleans up a number of bugs and documentation errors in 3.0.0.

=== Improved Documentation
<ul>
<li>
     A separate new document on a href=tasking.htm>multitasking</a>
     was added.

<li>
     Obsolete pre-open-source concepts in the 3.0.0 documentation
     were deleted or corrected.
     
</ul>

=== Bug Fixes
<ul>
<li>
     Euphoria-coded .dll / .so files were not working at all, due to a 
     multitasking-related glitch. Thanks to Andrea Cini.
     
     Note: execution of multitasking built-in routines is currently not 
     supported inside a Euphoria-coded .dll / .so. 
     You'll get a compile-time error message from the 
     Translator if you use the -dll option and your library source code 
     contains multitasking operations. Other than that, use of 
     Euphoria-coded .dll / .so files by main programs that do 
     multitasking is fine.</li>
    
<li>
     A text console bug was fixed.
     It involved output to the screen involving tabs and/or 
     wrap-around (at 80 columns). Thanks to 
     Pete Lomax, Juergen Luethje, Matt Lewis.</li>
<li>
     bind.bat, bindw.bat and shroud.bat were changed to use %EUDIR%
     rather than \EUPHORIA. Thanks to Ray Smith.</li>
<li>
     syncolor.e now includes keywords.e (relative to euphoria\bin)
     rather than \euphoria\bin\keywords.e. Thanks to Rick Bettis.</li>
    
</ul>

=== C Source Code Changes
<ul>
<li>
     All of the #ifdef ENCURSES code was stripped out.
     We don't plan to use ncurses again, and this change
     makes parts of the source code much more readable.</li>
<li>
     A thread5() machine language macro was added to be_execute.c 
     This helps the interpreter to compile correctly with 
     Open Watcom, avoiding a C optimizer bug.
     Thanks to Matt Lewis. </li>
</ul>
