== Version 2.5 Beta Release January 14, 2005:

=== Improved Performance

* The initial parse time (start-up time) of interpreted programs 
  has been reduced, typically by 25% on newer machines, and 40% on older
  machines, when compared to 2.5 alpha.  In the case of old machines running
  very large programs, the start-up time can be 65% to 90% less, especially when
  ##with trace## or ##with profile## are in effect.
* Most of the optimizations were made to the Euphoria front-end 
  source that's shared with the Public Domain source interpreter, so **eu.ex**
  also has reduced parse times.
* A major speed improvement was made in opASSIGN_SUBS() in the PD source 
  interpreter. This operation handles assignments to subscripted sequences, and
  is executed a lot. Thanks to Greg Haberek for showing the slowness.
* **Translator**: In many more cases, the **Translator** now knows the type of all 
  elements of a sequence. This is especially useful when the elements are known to be 
  integers. Smaller and faster code is generated for accessing the elements, and freeing 
  the sequence.
* In most cases, the **Interpreter** and the **Translator** now evaluate
  sequence-formation {a, b, c, ...} expressions once at compile-time, instead of
  each time at run-time, when the elements are all constant integers (either
  hard-coded numbers or symbols declared as constant). This saves time, and also
  reduces code size for translated programs.
* **database.e**: **db_select_table()** returns quickly if you happen to select
  the table that's already selected. This can save a lot of time in situations
  where it's not convenient for the application to keep track of which table is
  currently selected.  Thanks to Derek Parnell.

=== Enhanced Features

* The **shrouder** will now supply a default **#!** (shebang) line at the top of
  the **.il** file, if none was specified. Thanks to Kenneth Rhodes.
* On **Linux**, the **shrouder** will give the **.il** file execute permission.
  Thanks to Kenneth Rhodes.
* On **Linux/FreeBSD** the **Binder** no longer creates bound executable programs
  with a ".exe" extension. Now, no extension is used. This is compatible with the
  **Translator**, and more in keeping with the standard on **Linux/FreeBSD**
  systems. Thanks to Jerry Story.
* **database.e**: Extra checks were added to some routines to give a more
  meaningful error message when no table has been selected yet. Thanks to Derek
  Parnell.
* Several small improvements in the Source Code product and its documentation
  make it easier to compile using Open Watcom and other compilers. Thanks to
  Jean-Marc Duro.
* The main source file is now closed right after the front-end finishes.  This
  allows a program to edit or otherwise modify its own source.
* The initial random seed value is now chosen more randomly
  on **Windows**. Thanks to Yuku Sugianto.

=== DOS/Windows Installation Program

* The install program will set up ed.bat to run ed.ex with ex.exe on ME/98/95,
  and exwc.exe on NT/2000/XP.
* The **install** program will not change any existing file associations for
  Euphoria file types. (If you install Euphoria in a new directory, you might
  have to change these yourself.) Thanks to Juergen Luethje and others.
* The Start Menu links created by the **install** program were wrong: exw was 
  incorrectly pointing to **ecw.exe**, and ex was incorrectly pointing 
  to **ec.exe**. Thanks to Yuku Sugianto.
* It's ok now to have a blank in the path of the installation directory: e.g.
  "C:\Program Files". Thanks to Rich.

=== Bug Fixes

* **bug fixed**: When building a Linux/FreeBSD .so file from Euphoria code that
  contained **call_proc()** or **call_func()**, an undefined "~_~_stdcall" symbol
  appeared in the C file by mistake. Thanks to Matt Lewis.
* **bug fixed**: The opening message displayed by the Binder on Linux/FreeBSD and
  on Windows was wrong.  Thanks to Kenneth Rhodes and Igor Kachan.
* **bug fixed**: **routine_id()** was checking for symbols coming later in the
  code. This happened in the Interpreter only, and only at the top-level, not
  inside a routine.\\
  This fix requires .il files shrouded with 2.5 alpha to be reshrouded
  with 2.5 beta or later. Bound files are not a problem.
* **bug fixed**: A complex expression on the left hand side of an assignment, involving 
  nested use of ##$##, could crash. Thanks to Andy Serpa.
* **bug fixed -  Translator: ** A call to **routine_id()** would sometimes search
  past the end of a list and start reading garbage in memory. In most instances
  this did not cause a problem, but in some cases it could cause a crash. Thanks
  to Kenneth Rhodes.
* **bug fixed -  Translator: ** In a rare situation, the 2.5 alpha Translator
  could crash while attempting to optimize some code.
* **bug fixed -  Translator: ** In a rare situation, at the end of execution of a
  particular routine, the translated code would fail to free some space used for
  a temporary value.  Thanks to Wolfgang Fritz.
* **bug fixed**: After a compile error in **exw** you would have to hit Enter,
  then a message would say: "Press Enter...".  (Things worked properly for
  run-time errors).  Thanks to Tone Skoda.</li>
* **bug fixed**: An incompatibility existed between the way that **abort(1)** was
  handled in the Translator vs the Interpreter. Thanks to Juergen Luethje.
* **bug fixed**: **save_text_image()**, when run by **exw** or **exwc**,
  occasionally returned some garbage in the upper bits of the character
  attributes. Thanks to Brian Broker.
* **bug fixed**: The CAPS lock key generated a key code when using **ed** with
  **exwc**. The key had the desired effect, but it caused **ed** to display a message 
  at the top of the screen. **ed** will no longer display the message. Thanks Alex 
  Caracatsanis.
* **bug fixed**: **routine_id("")** would crash the Binder and Translator. Thanks
  to Antonio Alessi.
* **bug fixed**: A line longer than 200 chars crashed the **trace** display.
 Thanks to Thomas Betterly.
* **bug fixed**: Symbols declared as constant were not defined in the **trace**
  window.  Thanks to Matthew Lewis.
* **bug fixed**: **printf()** format strings were wrong in two error messages in
  **execute.e** &nbsp;Thanks to Derek Parnell.
* **bug fixed**: The caret (arrow) symbol, 
  displayed in compile-time error messages, was shifted one position to the
  right, when compared with version 2.4. This has been corrected.  Thanks to
  Juergen Luethje.
* **bug fixed**: For compatibility with the official Interpreter, routine id's 
  now start at 0 instead of 1 in the PD source interpreter.

=== Documentation

* A paragraph was added to "Scope" discussing how you can override predefined
  routines with your own variables and routines.  Thanks to Mike.
* A warning was added to **open()** about the use of CON and CON.*, and other
  file names that are reserved by DOS.  Thanks to Igor Kachan.
* The fact that programs are now fully parsed before being executed was explained
  better in the Reference Manual.
* Obsolete uses of the phrase "Complete Edition" were removed from a few places
  in the documentation. Thanks to Juergen Luethje.
* Various documents were fixed where miscellaneous 2.4 information 
  has now become now obsolete.
* The Reference Manual said that the limit on nested include files was 10 deep.
  It should have said 30 deep. Thanks to Darkvincentdude.
* In the PD source interpreter, **eu.ex**, there was an error in the 
  comments at the top. Thanks to Yuku Sugianto.
* The fact that **crash_message()** is now only useful for run-time errors was
  made clear. Thanks to Juergen Luethje.
* A bad HTML link to the WIN32 API .hlp file was fixed.  Thanks to "Bro
  George".
* Many other minor clarifications were made.
