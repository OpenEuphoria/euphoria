== Version 2.2 Linux November 22, 1999:

* **All platforms: bug fixed:**
If a Euphoria routine called itself recursively from inside a
for-loop, and at one level of recursion the for-loop counted //up// 
to an upper limit, and at another level of recursion the for-loop 
counted //down// to a 
lower limit, the for-loop would probably malfunction at one of the levels.
Thanks to Delroy Gayle.
* The documentation was improved in many places, especially with respect
to the Linux platform.
