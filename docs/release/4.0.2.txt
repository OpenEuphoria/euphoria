== Version 4.0.2 Date TBD

=== Bug Fixes

* Fixed ##[[:canonical_path]]## performance issues introduced in 4.0.1.
* [[ticket:646]] ##[[:dir]]## can now handle multiple wildcards on non-Windows platforms
* [[ticket:647]] The version detection system has been improved so that all binaries use
  the same C header file, which should prevent the potential of mismatched versions.
* [[ticket:644]] ##[[:canonical_path]]## leaves alone path components (and anything after them)
  with wildcards.
* Fixed compiler directives about functions that don't return.  Removed some that were obsolete,
  and corrected for MinGW to use the GCC directives.
* [[ticket:648]] Fix small memory leak from while loops

=== New Functionality

* The ##std\rand.e function##, **##sample()##**, now implements both //with replacement//
and //without replacement// sampling methods.
