==  Version 2.2 alpha-test release for Linux August 24, 1999:


//Many of these features and bug fixes will also be made available 
in Version 2.2 for **WIN32 + DOS32**//. 

<li>
 The documentation has been brought up-to-date to include 
  **Linux**-specific information for library
  routines and Euphoria in general.
<li>
 There is now a Complete Edition for
  **Linux**, including
  **binding** and 
  **shrouding**. See
  **register\register.doc**.
<li>
 There is now **text mode** mouse support using
  **get_mouse()**. You must have **GPM
  server** running. It works in a text console or an **xterm** window.
<li>
 **Linux:**
  **define_c_var(name)** will return the
  address of a global C variable in a shared library.
<li>
 It was confirmed that you can call Euphoria routines from
  **Linux** C routines using exactly the same
  mechanism as in **WIN32** Euphoria.
  See **euphoria/demo/linux**.
<li>
 An example of creating your own shared library routines and calling them from
  Euphoria was added. See
  **euphoria/demo/linux**.
<li>
 **All platforms: crash_file(file_name)** will
  cause diagnostic messages to be written to **file_name** instead of
  **ex.err**. You can use 
  **crash_file("/dev/null")** to get
  diagnostics on screen but not in a file.<br>
  **crash_file("")** means
  "no diagnostics" (to screen or ex.err). 
<li>
 **Trace** mode in **xterm** now detects
  the **F1/F2** keys.
<li>
 **time()** now reports real "wall-clock" time,
  not CPU time.
<li>
 **search**,
  **guru** and
  **cdguru** now place their output in your
  $HOME directory instead of the current directory.
<li>
 **#!** is now restricted to just the first line of a file.
<li>
 **All platforms:** In **ed**, the
  **Esc n**, **Esc d**, **Esc f** and **Esc r** commands will
  immediately redisplay your last choice. You can press
  **up-arrow/down-arrow** to 
  see other choices, or clear the choice. If you start typing without
  editing, it will clear the choice and take your new input.
<li>
 **free_console()** will set the terminal
  parameters back to normal. Normally, when running a Euphoria program the
  parameters are set the way that **curses** wants them and they are set
  back to normal when the program terminates.
  If your program needs to terminate
  in a strange way (other than calling abort()),
  **free_console()** should be called first. 
<li>
 **bug fixed: <font color="#006699">get()</font>
  ** now considers '\r' to be a whitespace character. This is important when
  reading DOS files.
<li>
 **All platforms: bug fixed:** It was not
  immediately issuing a **type_check** 
  failure when 1 was added to an integer variable that was set to the maximum
  value for an integer (1.07 billion). Thanks to Jeff Fielding.
<li>
 **All platforms: bug fixed:** It was not
  always detecting an improperly-formed 
  exponent on a floating-point number. Thanks to Lionel Wong.
<li>
 **All platforms:** The performance of the storage allocator has been 
  improved in certain cases. A bug that could cause the interpreter to 
  crash when you are almost out of memory has been fixed. 
</ul>
