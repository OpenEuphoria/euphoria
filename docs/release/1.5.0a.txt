== Version 1.5a June 13, 1997:

* Many operations and library routines were optimized. 
* **get_key()** is 100x faster when there is no key in the buffer.
* **get_all_palette()** is over 100x faster and this makes **save_screen()** much
  faster.
* The following routines have now been built directly into **ex.exe**, to avoid
  the overhead of calling machine_proc() or machine_func(): **pixel()**,
  **get_pixel()**, **mem_set()**, **mem_copy()**.
* **poke()** of a long sequence into memory, other than video memory, is 50% faster.
* **pixel()** is 4x faster in mode 19.
* **get_pixel()** is faster in all modes.
* **display_image()** is about 30% faster in most modes and up to 4x faster in
  mode 19, because <br>pixel() is faster.
* All arithmetic and bitwise operations applied to sequences of integers are now 29% faster.  
* a **&** b (concatenation) is 15% faster in most cases, and is dramatically faster in the case 
  where you grow a very long sequence by concatenating many small sequences onto it. 
* **getc()** is 12% faster.
* **match()** is 8% faster in typical cases.
* **append()/prepend()** are 15% faster in many cases.
* **find()** of an integer within a sequence of integers is 64% faster.
* Formation of a 2-element sequence **{a,b}** is 11% faster.
* Internal copying of a shared sequence when it can no longer be shared is 15%
  faster.
