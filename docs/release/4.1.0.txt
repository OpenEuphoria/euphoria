== Version 4.1.0 Date TBD

== Bug Fixes

* [[ticket:665]] Fixed to load socket routines from its DLL only when needed.

== Enhancements

* Euphoria can be built natively as a 64-bit programming language.
* Added 8-byte memory access: [[:poke8], [[:peek8s]], [[:peek8u]]
* eucoverage also outputs a file "big_routines.html" that shows covered routines
  from all files sorted by descending routine size
* Added [[:poke_pointer]] and [[:peek_pointer]]
* New [[:sizeof]] built-in for determining size of certain data types.
* [[ticket:631]] Scientific parsing code moved from the euphoria source directory and into the
  standard library.  Routines in ##std/get.e## now return the proper precision data
  based on the native platform (32 or 64 bits).
* Users can write their own debuggers and use them instead of the built in trace debugger.
* gcc builds now include -fPIC (position independent code) runtime libraries for translating
  euphoria code into shared objects.
* -lib-pic switch for translator to specify the PIC runtime library to be used
* [[ticket:166]] get_integer{16,32} will return -1 on EOF.
* Added [[:deprecate]] keyword
* Architecture ifdefs (X86, X86_64, ARM, BITS32, BITS64, LONG32, LONG64)
* -arch option for translator for cross translating
* [[ticket:657]] name_of call added for display of alternative literals
* [[ticket:657]] warnings are displayed when two variables or literals of distinct enumerated types are compared or one is assigned to the other.
* -cc-prefix option for translator
* Can [[assign to multiple variables -> :Multiple Assignment]] with one statement using sequence semantics.
* Use ##?## to stand in for default parameters.
* eudis now tabulates counts of forward references
