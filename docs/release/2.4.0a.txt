== Version 2.4 Alpha February 21, 2003:

=== New Features

*  Most machine-level exceptions (peek/poke to bad addresses etc.)
  in both the main program and in .dlls, are now caught by
  **exw**
  and **exu**, 
  and reported in the usual way, with a full traceback and
  **ex.err** 
  variable dump. This is a great improvement over the cryptic 
  machine-level messages you used to get (and still get when using
  compiled languages, and most interpreted languages) about 
  "segmentation violation", "illegal instruction" etc.). 
  Thanks to Martin Stachon.

*  In addition to ##__stdcall##, the C ##__cdecl## calling
  convention 
  is now supported for calls to C routines in .dll's and also call-backs 
  to Euphoria routines from C code.
  
*  Euphoria's support for DOS long filenames has been extended to
  Windows XP.

*  The **trace** screen shows you large
  sequences in pretty-print display on a separate
  screen. You can scroll through the whole sequence.
  
*  **pretty_print()** was added to
  **misc.e**. 
  It lets you display Euphoria objects
  with a nice, readable structured display, and many formatting options.

*  Pretty-printing of sequences is now done in
  **ex.err**,
  the **?** command, and
  **db_dump()**. 
  
*  **Euphoria Database System (EDS)**:
  **db_rename_table(name, new_name)**
  was added to **database.e**.
  This routine was submitted by Jordah Ferguson, and included 
  with only trivial changes.

*  **Linux/FreeBSD**:
  **system()** no longer initializes
  curses when there is no console window yet. Thanks to Daniel Johnson.

*  The number of levels of nested include files has been raised to 30 (from 10).
  Thanks to Tone Skoda.

*  Include statement path names can have double-quotes around them, 
  so paths containing blanks can be handled correctly. This was 
  actually implemented for 2.3 but never documented.

*  **exw.exe**, and any executables
  produced by the **Translator** with Watcom,
  now have the subsystem set to 4.0 instead of 3.1. This improves the
  appearance of GUI's in some cases. The utility
  **make31.exw** will 
  create a version of **exw.exe** that
  supports Windows GUI 3.1 as before, 
  in the unlikely case that there are compatibility problems with
  Euphoria 2.3. Thanks to H. W. Overman, Brian Broker and others for 
  recommending this change.

*  **makecon.exw** - will create a version
  of **exw.exe** that
  operates as a console application - no console window is popped up,
  and **stdin/stdout** can be redirected

*  **trace(1 2 and 3)** are now allowed
  with **bind -clear**
  (still not allowed with **shrouded bind**
  for security reasons). Thanks to Jonas Temple.

* 
  **Translator**: You can now make a
  Euphoria .dll using Lcc and interface it with interpreted programs running
  under **exw**, and translated programs
  using Borland and Watcom. Previously, the main program had to also be
  compiled with Lcc.
  
*  The **Translator** no longer uses
  the **-m486** or **-mpentium** options available with
  GCC and DJGPP.
  These options were causing warnings, and the C compiler apparently
  sets the machine model correctly by itself. Thanks to Kenneth Rhodes.

*  The **Translator** will now perform 
  automatic calls
  to user-defined types, in the
  unusual case where the type routine has side-effects (it sets global
  variables, performs I/O etc.). Thanks to Andy Serpa.

*  **euphoria\demo\bench** compares 
  the 
  **Euphoria Interpreter** and the
  **Euphoria To C Translator** against
  more than 20 other interpreted languages.

  

=== Porting Activity

* We ported the **Interpreter**
  and **Translator**
  to **FreeBSD.**
  The source now has several C #ifdef's for FreeBSD.
  
* Andy Cranston has ported Euphoria to HP Unix, and he plans to do 
  Sun Unix.



=== Optimizations
	
==== Interpreter
  

*  Typical large slices are faster.
  About 30% faster for slices from about 100 to 50000 in length.
  (Overhead dominates for smaller slices, and lack of caching
  affects larger slices.)
  This assumes the slice is mostly integers (usually true), 
  and an actual copy of the data is made (usually true since v1.4b).
  
* Statements that contain multiple ##&## concatenations are much faster. 
  
  {{{        e.g. instead of:
             **result = a & b & c**
             being evaluated as:
               1. copy a and b into temp
               2. copy temp and c into result 
                  (a and b are effectively copied twice!)
  
             We now do:
               1. copy a and b and c directly into result
  }}}
  
  So there is less copying of data and fewer temp sequences to create.
  The more ##&## operators in an
  expression, the greater the speed-up. e.g. with 3
  ##&## operators some of the data
  was copied 3 times, etc.
  Jordah Ferguson pointed out that this was slow.

* The time overhead involved in calling and returning from a 
  Euphoria call-back routine has been reduced by about 10 percent.

* In **exw** and **ecw -wat**, allocation of space for large numbers of 
  objects is faster. It can be tremendously faster when hundreds of
  thousands or millions of objects are involved.
  
* Better UPX compression has chopped a few K off
  **exw.exe** vs. 2.3 
  (even though new code was added). Thanks to Wolfgang Fritz


==== Euphoria Database System

* Keys and records are read faster due to a faster
  **decompress()** routine.
  Almost twice as fast when the key or record data to be retrieved 
  consists mainly of sequences of characters or small integers. 
  This case is quite common.
   
* Allocating new space in a database is much faster, up to 4x faster,
  especially in large databases with a large list of free blocks
     
* Inserting and deleting records in huge tables is now much faster. 
  Combined with the speeded-up slices in Euphoria 2.4,
  **database.e** is
  now about 25% faster for a table with 10,000 records and 
  over 3x faster for a table with 100,000 records.
  This really only matters if you are trying to insert/delete hundreds
  of records per second. In the typical case of a human operator
  entering data via GUI, you would never notice the insert/delete time
  for one record (a few milliseconds). Derek Parnell pointed out the
  slowness.

* **db_select_table()** is significantly
  faster.

* **get4()** is faster which speeds up
  everything.
     
==== Other Optimizations

* **bytes_to_int()** in
  **machine.e** is now more than twice as fast.

* **gets()** is about 5% faster

* **sort()** and
  **custom_sort()** are a few percent faster.
  Thanks to Ricardo Forno for tweaking the Shell sort algorithm. 
  
* Several additional optimizations have been added to the
  **Translator**.
  It produces executables that are faster and smaller 
  than version 2.3. The 2.4 Translator has been successfully tested 
  on hundreds of thousands of lines of Euphoria code, and there are
  currently no known code generation bugs. Some Translator 
  benchmark results are in
  **euphoria\demo\bench**.


=== Bug Fixes


==== Source Code


* **bug fixed**: The
  **gnubsd** batch file referred to
  **syncolor.c** and
  **syncolor.o**.
  (**gnuexu** was ok.)
  
* **bug fixed**: Karl Bochert pointed out a necessary C coding 
  change to make **poke()** work with
  the latest version of Lcc. The change 
  corrected the **Translator** (with
  recent versions of Lcc) and the **Interpreter
  Source Code** (compiled with Lcc)
                

==== Interpreter 


* **bug fixed**: A crash might occur in situations where a call-back routine
  indirectly called itself recursively. Thanks to Matthew Lewis 
  and George Papadopoulos.

* **bug fixed**: In for-loops at the top-level of a program 
  (outside of any routine), 
  that incremented the loop variable by an integer other than the default 
  of +1, ##end for## was taking up to
  15x longer than necessary due to a 
  bug fix that was made back in November 1999. Only the
  ##end for##
  itself was slow, not the code contained in the body of the loop.
  Antoine Tammer detected this.

* **bug fixed**: On XP, when you open a new DOS window that has more than 25 lines,
  the Virtual DOS Machine (VDM) is at first confused about the true number
  of lines. The first time (only) when you ran a Euphoria program in 
  that window, if you ran it near the very bottom of the screen, the output 
  might disappear, or the VDM or Euphoria might report an error etc. 
  Euphoria (**ex.exe**) now detects the
  rare cases when VDM is
  confused and clears the screen, which clears up the confusion. 
  A similar problem existed on NT, and was fixed a few years ago.

* **bug fixed**: The interpreter was referring
  to "call back from Windows" in **ex.err**,
  even on Linux or FreeBSD. It now says "call-back from external source"
  on those systems. Thanks to Pete Eberlein.
  
* **bug fixed**: When an include file couldn't
  be found, the error message 
  referred to "euphoria\include". It now uses %EUDIR%\include
  
* **bug fixed**: An error message will no longer be generated on any platform 
  for ##without profile_time##. Thanks to Alan Oxley.


==== Translator 


* **bug fixed**: When assigning
  the result of an arithmetic calculation (typically multiply) 
  involving two integers, to a variable declared as atom, 
  where the atom variable had already (in the same basic block) 
  been assigned an integer value, the Translator might 
  not output any code to check for integer overflow (result outside
  of +/- one billion). This could cause a crash. Thanks to Andy Serpa.

* **bug fixed**: DJGPP strip.exe command
  in **emake.bat** would fail on XP,2000 due to
  a bug in DJGPP.
  Now **emake.bat** has: **SET LFN=n**
  to work around the bug in strip.exe  

* **bug fixed**: Translated code compiled
  with Borland C was not producing 
  INF's and NAN's, like Watcom and Lcc. Rather, it was crashing when
  a floating-point overflow (over 1e308), or an undefined f.p. 
  result was calculated. The **Interpreter Source
  Code** was also 
  corrected for those who wish to compile **exw.exe**
   using Borland.
  Thanks to Andy Serpa.
  
* **bug fixed**: In the first basic block
  of a Euphoria routine (i.e. before any control-flow statements),
  **peek4u()**, <font color="#006699">
  **peek4s()**, and the
  "add integer 1" operation, would sometimes neglect to check for 
  possible 31-bit integer overflow when assigning to a private variable 
  declared as atom, unless the variable had been previously
  initialized. Thanks to Mike Duffy.

* **bug fixed**: In some cases, when
  assigning a sequence element
  to a variable declared as integer, and known to have an integer value
  at this point, the case where the element was an integer value stored
  in C double form was not handled correctly.

* **bug fixed**: In rare cases, the
  translator might output two unary minus operators
  in a row, which would be parsed by a C compiler as the 
  C decrement operator "--".

* **bug fixed**: Euphoria .dll's were not
  always correctly freeing storage
  allocated by the main program, and vice versa. Memory could be wasted,
  and you might get a machine-level crash. Thanks to H. W. Overman.
  
  **Note:** Due to this fix, any Euphoria .dll's created with the 
  Translator version 2.3 or earlier, must be re-translated with 2.4, 
  and re-compiled, in order to interface with the Euphoria 2.4 (or later) 
  interpreter or translated code. New .dll's created with version 2.4 
  or later, will not work with the interpreter version 2.3 or earlier, 
  except in trivial cases.

* **bug fixed**: The
  **sleep(x)** function was only sleeping
  for x milliseconds 
  when using the Lcc run-time library. It now sleeps for x seconds, 
  to conform with the Euphoria documentation for
  **sleep()**. Thanks to Wolfgang Fritz.
  
* **bug fixed**: On some versions of Linux, a translated/compiled Euphoria
  program would crash if standard output was redirected, e.g. for CGI

* **bug fixed**: On some versions of Linux, a translated/compiled Euphoria
  program would crash if machine(M_GET_SCREEN_CHAR, {row, col}) were called.

* **bug fixed**: In some cases the code was not correct when an 
  integer variable was assigned the unary minus of an atom variable.

* **bug fixed**: In a very rare case, an uninitialized value in memory
  might be used to determine if a literal floating-point value should be
  treated as an integer or not. Incorrect code could result.
  


==== Binder 


  
* **bug fixed**: The binder would crash
  after seeing a comment with no new-line character, just EOF, on the last
  line of a file. Some versions of Win32Lib.ew had this.
   Thanks to Henri Goffin.

* **bug fixed**: The usage report of
  **bind**/<font color="#993333">**shroud**
   still said "-scramble", instead of "-clear" and had other
  errors for Linux/FreeBSD. Thanks to Chris Bensler.

* **bug fixed**:
  **bind/shroud -clear** might neglect to 
  rename a private variable, when an earlier local variable gets renamed 
  into the same name. Thanks to Pete Lomax.

* **bug fixed**: When an include file was
  missing ##\n## on the last line,
  **bind/shroud -clear** might neglect to leave some whitespace 
  before the next word in the main file. Thanks to Pete Lomax.
  
* **bug fixed**: If you defined a constant
   that was never used, and
   it was defined using an expression that contained a binary 
   minus operator, a syntax error could occur in the bound or 
   shrouded file that you create. Thanks to Chris Bensler.

==== Library Routines 

* **bug fixed**: 
  **walk_dir("/",...)** would fail on Linux.
  Thanks to Ricardo Forno.

* **bug fixed**:
  **db_compress()** of EDS had an error
  if the database file or it's path contained a blank character. A
  blank is ok now on all platforms except DOS. Thanks to Virtual B.

* **bug fixed**:
  **wildcard_file()** in
  **euphoria\include\wildcard.e** is now case 
  sensitive on Linux/FreeBSD (but is still case insensitive on DOS/Windows). 
  Thanks to Jeff Fielding.

* **bug fixed**:
  **dir()** was not always reporting file
  sizes greater than 1 Gb correctly. It now handles up to 4 Gb. Arithmetic
  performed on the file size would probably fail. Thanks to Ricardo Forno.

* **bug fixed**:
  **where()** was not always reporting file
  positions greater than 1 Gb
  correctly. Arithmetic performed on the position would probably fail. 
  It now handles up to 2 Gb.

* **bug fixed**:
  **ex, exw, ec -wat, ecw -wat**: The
  **dir()** function for 
  DOS and Windows was not handling wildcards correctly when a backslash 
  appeared at the end of the file or directory path. Thanks to Juergen Luethje.

==== Namespace Feature 


* **bug fixed**: If you tried to declare a
  new variable, using a namespace
  qualifier, e.g. **integer y:x** (which is illegal)
  it wouldn't complain, and would just ignore the "y:" part,
  as long as y:x was a routine (not a variable) in an earlier file. 
  This is now caught as an error. Thanks to Martin Stachon.

* **bug fixed**: When declaring the type of a parameter, using a global type that was
  defined in more than one file, you would get an unclear error
  message stating "a type is expected here". Now you'll get a
  message pointing out that the type requires a namespace identifier
  to resolve it. Thanks to Juergen Luethje.
   
* **bug fixed**: The error message that you get if you specify a namespace
  qualifier and a ':', but you neglect to follow it with a properly-formed 
  identifier, has been improved.  Thanks to Carl White.

==== Demo Programs 
  
* **bug fixed**:
  In the **window.exw** demo program,
  **allocate(64)** and
  **allocate(16)** 
  caused a storage leak. Thanks to Wolfgang Fritz and Jordah Ferguson.

==== Trace/Debug 
  

* **bug fixed**: When
  **trace(0)** was executed, followed later by
  **trace(1)**, with no
  screen I/O in between, the values of some variables on the trace screen 
  were not updated. Thanks to Ricardo Forno.

* **bug fixed**:
  **with trace** /
  **with profile** /
  **trace(3)**, used all together,
  produced garbage source lines in
  **ctrace.out**. Thanks to Kat.
