== Version 2.1 alpha-test release January 15, 1999:

<li>
 We've made a number of changes to the packaging, pricing, and registration
 incentives for the Euphoria product:


<li>
     The Dual-Platform (DOS32+WIN32) package, formerly $53 has been reduced
     to $39 U.S., effective immediately.
<li>
     The Single-Platform (DOS32-only) package, formerly $32, has been
     discontinued.
<li>
     The printed manual has been discontinued. Instead, there is now an
     official HTML version of the manual, included with the Public Domain
     .zip file.
<li>
     All useful 3rd-party include files, such as **Win32Lib.ew** and many
     others, will be "stamped" by RDS with a code number that makes them
     **//free//**, just like the files in
     **euphoria\include**. They will not 
     add to your statement count, provided you do not significantly modify
     them. This will also allow 3rd-party developers to get better diagnostic
     information from their users.
<li>
     **Binding**,
     **shrouding** and
     **profiling** will now be part of the
     Complete Edition only. These are features that beginners do not require,
     but serious users might find valuable.

</ul>

<li>
 Short-form assignment operators **&nbsp; += &nbsp;
 -= &nbsp; *= &nbsp; /= &nbsp; &= &nbsp;** have been added. 
 For example, instead of saying:
<eucode>
           count = count + 1
</eucode>
 You can now say:
<eucode>
           count += 1
</eucode>

 Instead of saying:
<eucode>
           matrix[row][column] = matrix[row][column] * 5.0
</eucode>
 You can say:
<eucode>
           matrix[row][column] *= 5.0
</eucode>

 Instead of saying:
<eucode>
           test_scores[start..finish] = test_scores[start..finish] / 100
</eucode>
 You can say:
<eucode>
           test_scores[start..finish] /= 100
</eucode>
 See a class="blue" href="refman_2.htm#assignop">
 **refman.doc**</a> for the details.

<li>
 Euphoria now uses "short-circuit" evaluation of
 ##and## and
 ##or## expressions in
 **if/elsif/while** conditions.
 e.g. in an ##and## condition:
<eucode>
           if A and B then ...
</eucode>
   the interpreter will skip the evaluation of expression B whenever 
   expression A is 0 (false), since it knows that the overall result
   must be false. In an ##or## condition:
<eucode>
           while A or B do ...
</eucode>
   the interpreter will skip the evaluation of expression B whenever
   expression A is non-zero (true), since it knows that the overall result
   must be true.

   Euphoria code written prior to version 2.1 may no longer work correctly if
   expression B contains a function with **//side-effects//** such as
   setting a global variable, doing I/O etc. In practice this kind of code is
   very rare, but just in case, a warning will now be issued if a function
   with side-effects might be short-circuited. 

   By skipping the evaluation of B, short-circuit evaluation is typically
   faster, and will allow you to write statements such as:
<eucode>
           if atom(x) or length(x)=1 then ...
</eucode>
   that would generate an error on older versions of Euphoria whenever x
   was an **atom**, since
   length() is not defined for atoms.

   See a class="blue" href="refman_2.htm#shortcir">
   **refman.doc**</a> for the details.

   See a class="blue" href="library.htm">**library.doc**
   </a> for the details.

<li>
 The main Euphoria documentation can now be viewed locally with a Web 
   browser. The plain-text files **refman.doc**
   and **library.doc** are still 
   available in the **doc** subdirectory,
   but we now have **refman.htm** and 
   **library.htm** in the new
   **html** subdirectory. We have developed
   a tool (written in Euphoria) that lets us easily maintain both an
   up-to-date HTML version, and an up-to-date plain-text version of
   **refman** and
   **library**.
  
   The documentation has also been clarified and expanded in many places.

<li>
 **WIN32:** you can create an
 **unlimited** number of Euphoria
 call-back routines,
   as long as each routine is a function with 0 to 8 parameters. 
   See a class="blue" href="platform.htm#callback">
   **platform.doc**</a>. In version 2.0 you could only have one
   call-back routine and it had to have exactly 4 parameters.

<li>
 The ##xor## keyword has been added to
  complement: **and/or/not** and
  **xor_bits()** e.g.
<eucode>
           if a xor b then...
</eucode>
   ##xor## works on sequences too.
   It's similar to ##or##.

<li>
 The **dir(path)** library routine now
 officially supports the use of **wildcards *** and **?** in the path
 that you supply. This feature was always available, but wasn't
 documented until now. e.g.
<eucode>
           info = dir("mydata\\*.d?t")
</eucode>

<li>
 **optimization:**
  Subroutine call+return overhead was reduced by an average of 
   30%. The speed-up occurs for all normal function/procedure/type calls, 
   user-defined type-checks,
   call_proc()/call_func() calls using a
   **routine id**, 
   and Windows call-backs. Only recursive calls cost the same as before. 
   Programs with a reasonably-high frequency of calls can easily be 10% faster 
   overall because of this.

<li>
 **optimization:**
 Branch ##//straightening//## has been
  implemented. The compiler will optimize branches in the internal code
   such that a branch from A->B where location B contains a branch to
   location C, will be optimized to a direct branch from A->C. Even something
   like A->B->C->D can be straightened to A->D. This often occurs in
   while-loops that contain if-statements.

<li>
 **optimization:**
 In many cases, variable initialization checks are
   now replaced by "no-ops" after the first check is performed. Euphoria
   was already optimizing out many checks at compile-time.

<li>
 **optimization:**
 **get()** and
 **value()** are now much faster in most
  cases thanks to Jiri Babor and some further optimizations by RDS.
   The new v2.1 **ex.exe** with the new
   v2.1 **get.e** is:
<blockquote>
          
          1.45x faster reading a sequence of f.p. numbers from a file and<br>
          2.25x faster when reading a sequence of integers from a file.
</blockquote>

<li>
 **optimization:**
 **power(x,2)** is converted internally
  to x*x which is faster in all cases, especially when x is a large
  integer or a f.p. number. 

<li>
 **optimization:** Thanks to Jiri Babor,
 **int_to_bits()** is at least 15% faster
   in most cases.

<li>
 **optimization:**
 Plotting a long sequence of pixels in 16-color graphics modes 
 is about 3% faster.

<li>
 **optimization:**
 **draw_line()** has been sped up by a
  few percent.

<li>
 **Language War** has had a major
 face-lift. It now runs in **pixel-graphics
   mode 18** (640 x 480 x 16 colors) instead of
   **text mode**. It also has 
   ##//fine-grain//## parallelism,
   i.e. virtually anything can happen in parallel 
   with anything else. Multiple torpedos, phasors etc can be drawn on the 
   screen simultaneously, while ships are moving, commands are being entered,
   things are exploding etc. Even the timing needed for the PC speaker sound 
   effects is handled by the **task scheduler**. There are
   **//no//** time-delay "busy" 
   loops executed during the game. The galaxy scan now shows you a scaled 
   picture of the whole galaxy, rather than just a bunch of numbers.

<li>
 The default print format for atoms was changed from "%g" to "%**.**10g".
   This format is used by print(),
   **?**,
   the **trace** facility, and
   **ex.err** dumps. This allows large
   integers -9,999,999,999 to +9,999,999,999
   to be printed as integers, rather than as scientific notation. It also 
   provides about 10 digits of accuracy to be displayed on fractional numbers,
   rather than just 6. Art Adamson and others made it clear that more 
   digits should be displayed.

<li>
 The state of all **with/without** settings
  is saved upon entering an **included file**, and restored at the end
  of the **included file**. An included file can change the settings,
  but they will be restored at the end of the included file. e.g. warnings
   might be turned off just within the included file (and any files it
   includes). As a result some 
   programs now display warnings where none were seen before.

<li>
 Warnings are now displayed
 <_ba>//after//</_ba> your program finishes
 execution, so they won't be erased by
 clear_screen(),
 graphics_mode() etc.
 Some programs now show warnings where none were seen before.

<li>
 The security of scrambled code and bound code has been improved thanks to 
 ideas contributed by Rusty Davis. When a bound program starts executing,
 a quick integrity check will be made to detect any corruption or tampering.
 It's still ok to add data to the end of a
 **bound .exe** file, as long as
 your last line is ##abort(x)##.

<li>
 The **ed** editor now lets you view and
 edit beyond column 80.

<li>
 **ed** has a new command: **Esc m**
 (modifications). It will show the differences between the original file on
 disk and the current edit buffer. This can be very useful when you've
 forgotten what changes you've made, and you are wondering if it's safe to
 save them.

<li>
 The **trace** window now provides an upper
 case **Q** command which lets the program run to completion, ignoring
 any trace(1) commands. Lower case
 **q** lets it run to the next trace(1).

<li>
 **safe.e** (debug version of
 **machine.e**) has been enhanced. It will now 
   automatically catch additional cases where data is illegally written just 
   **//before//**, or just **//after//**, the boundaries of an
   allocated block of memory. This can be particularly useful in
   **WIN32** where Windows might overwrite 
   one of your under-sized blocks. Without a tool such as
   **safe.e**, this type 
   of bug could take hours or even days to track down.

<li>
 The **euphoria\tutorial** directory
 was created to hold several small tutorial programs.

<li>
 The limit on the number of open files was raised to 25 from 15.
   Three of these files are 0,1,2: standard-input, standard-output 
   and standard-error, so you can now have up to 22 of your own files
   open simultaneously. (As far as we know, no one ever exceeded the old 
   limit, but it seemed wise to raise it.)

<li>
 When the user simply types ##ex## or
 ##exw## and is prompted for the 
   name of the Euphoria **.ex** or **.exw** file to run,
   **command_line()** will now 
   be updated to include the filename as the second command-line argument,
   just as if the user had originally typed: ##ex filename##.
   Thanks to Mathew Hounsell for suggesting this.

<li>
 **mset.ex** now saves pictures in **.bmp**
 format. Previously it was using a non-standard, compressed format.

<li>
 **lines.ex**
 (**lines.bat**) now reports
 non-blank/non-comment lines as well. This is
 <_ba>//not//</_ba> the same as the
 "statement count" used by Euphoria for the diagnostic limit, but it's
 usually within +/- 10%, assuming you write one statement per line.

<li>
 Numeric literals greater than 1e308 (roughly) are now set to
 **+/-** ##inf##. They used to cause a compile-time error.

</ul>
