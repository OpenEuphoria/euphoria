== Version 4.0.0 Release Candidate 2 (Release Date TBD)

=== Deprecation

* ##[[:find_from]]## and ##[[:match_from]]## have been deprecated. ##[[:find]]## and 
  ##[[:match]]## accept an optional argument (##start##) allowing these functions to be a
  100% drop in replacement.

=== Removed

* [[ticket:371]], ##replace_all## has been removed as it was a duplicate of the
                  more powerful [[:match_replace]] routine.
* [[ticket:376]], ##mouse.e## and ##std/mouse.e##
* [[ticket:484]], ##wildcard_file## is very DOS centric, doesn't act right at all on
                  modern consoles. It has been removed.
* [[ticket:486]], ##can_add## docs have been removed, they pointed to the name change
                  of ##can_add## to ##binop_ok##, changed during beta stage.
* [[ticket:487]], ##wildcard:new()##, method really didn't make sense as a planning
                  stage for regex usage as too much would have to change, a simply call
                  to new did not save much and possibly just caused bad programming
                  methods to be used.
* Support for alternate style eu.cfg sections, i.e. bind:unix and unix:bind were 
  previously supported, now only the documented method: bind:unix is accepted.

=== Bug Fixes

* [[ticket:118]], ##object()## tests now function properly when translated.
* [[ticket:169]], ##[[:find_nested]]## no longer defaults the ##rtn_id## parameter
                  to ##-1## as that is the "invalid" return value of [[:routine_id]]
                  in which case a typo in your routine id would be silently ignored
* [[ticket:335]], ##eui## now only accepts -v, ~-~-version as parameters to display
                  the version number instead of -v, ~-~-v, -version and ~-~-version.
* [[ticket:338]], Fixed //Data Execution Prevention// for FreeBSD systems.
* [[ticket:339]], Fixed locale for FreeBSD systems.
* [[ticket:341]], Removed unused variables in the standard library.
* [[ticket:343]], Resolution of unqualified symbols from other files is deferred until
                  all files that could cause symbol resolution conflicts have been read.
* [[ticket:345]], Forward patches now update the stack space for a routine when
                  they create temps.
* [[ticket:349]], Fixed resolution of qualified public symbols when the namespace points
                  to the wrong file, but the namespace file directly includes the file with
                  the actual routine
* [[ticket:352]], A function with a defaulted parameter that is both forward
                  referenced and inlined no longer crashes.
* [[ticket:358]], The programs eutest, creolehtml, and eudoc now all support a
                  command line option to display their version number.
* [[ticket:362]], The handing of regular expressions which match the text but
                  didn't have any matching sub-groups was not correct nor
                  documented.
* [[ticket:366]], Created a new module, base64, to implement the standard
                  Base-64 encoding algorithms.
* [[ticket:367]], ##[[:http_post]]## properly handles multi-part form data.
* [[ticket:372]], When an application ends, it closes all the opened files. 
                  However if it was ending due to an syntax error, it was
                  closing those files before trying to access the message 
                  text database that had been opened, thus causing a seek() to fail
                  and crash the application.
* [[ticket:378]], On Linux and FreeBSD, the socket tests failed to detect the
                  correct error code.
* [[ticket:392]], ##[[:seek]]## was not returning the correct failure code on
                  some errors.
* [[ticket:396]], Continue operations are now properly back patched.
* [[ticket:391]], Watcom build system was lacking the ability to build the manual.
* [[ticket:402]], ##[[:maybe_any_key]]## now works when run from the command line version
                  of EUPHORIA even when run without a command-line shell.
* [[ticket:403]], Many documentation examples used ? func() and showed the output in
                  string format which ? does not do. It was misleading to the new person
                  to Euphoria. Found instances have been updated.
* [[ticket:405]], ##dis.ex## no longer creates a build directory for no reason.
* [[ticket:409]], Calls to ##Head()## that should have altered the sequence in place
                  did not, resulting in slower code.
* [[ticket:417]], Accidental inclusion of TOC was removed
* [[ticket:418]], ##-debug## ##eu.cfg## switch text was corrected
* [[ticket:418]], Clarified what (all) and (translator) means
* [[ticket:425]], Fixed crash when branches were inlined into the top level
* [[ticket:426]], Eutest uses binary binder
* [[ticket:429]], ##tokenize.e## no longer drops the first character of a backtick string
* [[ticket:431]], ##tokenize.e## properly parses \xXX escapes
* [[ticket:434]], ##tokenize.e## no longer strips leading zeros on numbers when using
                  the ##[[:string_numbers]]## option.
* [[ticket:435]], ##tokenize.e## handles 0?NN numbers properly now. Returns 
                  ##[[:T_NUMBER]]## as the token type and either ##[[:TF_INT]]##
                  or ##[[:TF_HEX]]## as the form. If ##[[:string_numbers]]## is
                  enabled, the prefix is returned as part of the string, i.e.
                  ###integer a = 0b0101### will return ##"0b0101"##.
* [[ticket:439]], ##tokenize.e## fixed breakage with slice operator due to new string
                  number parsing.
* [[ticket:448]], Fixed ##splice()## translation.
* [[ticket:453]], Reworked the way open files are cleaned up so that coverage works properly
* [[ticket:457]], cmd_parse() now correctly honors the NO_HELP option and allows
                  the coder to override the default help switches.
* [[ticket:461]], Fixed error checking for invalid C routines for c_func / c_proc.
* [[ticket:464]], Fixed translated for loops that could result in incorrectly emitted brackets
* [[ticket:465]], Fixed stack space calculations for forward proc to func conversion and type checks.
* [[ticket:466]], Fixed line reporting on compile time type check error.
* [[ticket:467]], Fixed interpreter, translator and binder for handling multiple parameters
                  when one comes from a eu.cfg file and the other from the command line, but
                  the given option was designed to only be used ONCE, such as -batch
* [[ticket:469]], Fixed translated block comments
* [[ticket:471]], When using the ##-lib## parameter to ##euc##, it's canoncial path is used
                  and it's existance is checked before translation has begun to prevent wasting
                  time only to find the linker fails.
* [[ticket:472]], eui --help display is now in a logical display order.
* [[ticket:473]], euc --help display is now in a logical display order.
* [[ticket:475]], Fixed memory leak with interpreted [[:rand]]
* [[ticket:476]], ##euc## can now translated single character base filenames, i.e. h.ex
* [[ticket:477]], ##canonical_path## expansion of ~ now works in MSYS and CMD.exe with 
                  the MinGW build.
* [[ticket:479]], Installer now writes a eu.cfg, appends at the confirmation of the user.
* [[ticket:481]], RD_INPLACE, RD_PRESORTED, RD_SORT are now documented individually.
* [[ticket:485]], Fixed scanner initialization to prevent invalid accesses.
* [[ticket:491]], ##cmd_parse## now appends everything after the first extra to the 
                  ##OPT_EXTRAS## entry when ##NO_VALIDATION_AFTER_FIRST_EXTRA## is supplied
                  as a parsing option.
* Fixed [[:seek]] return value for large files on Linux.
* [[:connect]] return value was documented incorrectly.
* ##std/cmdline.e##, ##cmd_parse## sets the NO_CASE option when option does not have HAS_CASE.
* ##std/cmdline.e##, ##cmd_parse## sets the NO_PARAMETER option when option does not have HAS_PARAMETER.
* ##std/cmdline.e##, ##cmd_parse## sets the ONCE option when option does not have MULTIPLE.
* The euphoria coded backend (eu.ex) in some cases did not handle recursive calls correctly.
* Too numerous to list: Many documentation typo, spelling mistakes and formatting
  errors have been corrected.
* Removed many unnecessary ##[[:maybe_any_key]]## uses from the general demos
* ##net/http.e## now properly handles ##{ {key,value}, ...}##, ##{ encoding_type, {key,val}, ...}##
  and already encoded string data, ##"name=John%20Doe"##.
* Fixed eutext.ex and std/unittest.e. Under some circumstances, they would report 100%
  success even though there were some failures.

=== Enhancements/Changes

* [[ticket:334]], OS/X, FreeBSD and Linux distribution build scripts are now
                  combined for easier maintenance.
* [[ticket:341]], [[ticket:344]], Many unused variables have been cleaned up in the 
                  standard library.
* [[ticket:411]], documented the ##$## character as applied to a sequence terminator.
* ##manual-upload## target was added to GNU and Watcom makefiles
* Formatted ##buzz.ex## example
* ##euc## will always remove it's temporary build directory unless the ##-keep##
  option is supplied. If one wants to keep the build directory for some reason, they
  sould probably use ##-build-dir## as well, for example: ##euc -build-dir my-build 
  hello.ex## which will automatically keep the build directory since it was user specified.
* Converted ##bin/lines.ex## to use new language constructs and the standard library
  as an example of how an application take advantage of 4.0. Code base went from 591
  lines of code to 195 lines of code. Bugs were fixed, comment percentage calculations
  and header/footer lines were added in the new, smaller version as well.
* Moved network demos from ##demos/## to ##demos/net## for better organization.
* ##euphoria/tokenize.e## BLANK concept has changed. tokenize use to consume all newlines
  and only report double blanks. It now simply tokenizes the data and returns a newline
  if requested. ##keep_blanks## has been renamed to ##[[:keep_newlines]]## and 
  ##T_BLANK## has been renamed to ##[[:T_NEWLINE]]##. Thus the tokenizer doesn't perform
  any 'parser' functions, it simply tokenizes the source.
* Added ##show_tokens##, ##token_names## and ##token_forms## to ##euphoria/tokenize.e## to
  help in debugging both tokenize internal routines and applications that make use of
  ##euphoria/tokenize.e##
* Installer now creates a eu.cfg directory in EUDIR/bin
* Speed improvements to map:put()
* Demoted several "bin" programs to demos including:
** ##ascii.ex##
** ##eprint.ex##
** ##eused.ex##
** ##guru.ex##
** ##key.ex##
** ##search.ex##
** ##where.ex##
* All demos and bundled bin programs are unit tested to ensure at least eui -test passes
* Removed ##analyze.ex## as it never was a finished, deployable product
* eu.cfg "win32" sections ([win32], [bind:win32], [translate:win32], [bind:win32]) have
  now all been changed to "windows", not "win32"
* Removed demo/demo.doc and instead included in the header of each demo program what
  they do and included them into a section in the manual about demos.
* ##-test## parameter now displays warnings as well as errors
* Translator speed optimizations.
* Improved logging and error checking for sock_server.ex demo
* Renamed ##bin/lines.ex## to ##bin/euloc.ex## since it's more Euphoria centric now.
* Removed left-over translator command line parameter ##-fastfp## which was for DOS only.
* Reuse memory buffer in HSIEH32 hash implementation
* ##abbreviate_path## is used to cleanup the display from ##euc## regarding the Build 
  Directory.
* ##printf##s third argument is now optional. ##printf(1, "Hello\n", {})## is no longer
  needed, it can be shortened to ##printf(1, "Hello\n")##
* Added another hashing algorithm. HSIEH30 is identical to HSIEH32 but will only
  ever return a 30-bit integer (a Euphoria integer).
* Removed hash elements from map.e and placed them in a new standard library module, hash.e
* Performance tweaks to maps.
