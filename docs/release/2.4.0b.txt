== Version 2.4 Beta-test Release April 10, 2003:


This release updates the **Euphoria 
Interpreter**, the **Euphoria To C 
Translator**,
and the **Interpreter Source Code** products,
for **Windows**,
**DOS**,
**Linux** and
**FreeBSD**.

=== New Features


* **bind** and
    **shroud** now have an option
    ##-out## for specifying the output file,
    so you won't be prompted for it. Thanks to Jonas Temple, Rusty Davis 
    and others.
  
* **bind**
    and **shroud** now have an option
    ##-quiet## that suppresses normal messages
    and statistics, and therefore eliminates the window that normally pops up.
    Only errors are reported. Thanks to Jonas Temple.

* The namespace error message that's issued when you refer to a global 
    symbol that's defined in two or more files, now 
    gives you a list of all the files where that symbol 
    has been defined. Thanks to Derek Parnell and Irv Mullins.
  
* **Translator**: In many cases,
    the C code generated for **remainder()**,
    integer multiplication, and **compare()**
    is smaller and faster.

* **exw, ecw -wat**: Deallocation of space for huge numbers of small 
    objects (atoms or small sequences) is much faster than in 2.4 alpha. 
    Thanks to Andy Serpa.
    (Note that //allocation// of huge numbers of small objects in **exw**,
    or **ecw -wat**, became much faster in 2.4 alpha, 
    and remains much faster.)

* When an **ex.err** file is created,
    any warnings issued against the program will be listed at the end of
    the **ex.err** file. Thanks to Al Getz.
  
* The file name is now included in the warning message that you get for
    some of the common warnings (variable not used, variable not assigned to).
    Thanks to Al Getz.

* **New Icon**: On
    **Windows**, Euphoria include files are
    now labelled with a gray-scale version of the Euphoria ##E)## icon.
    This lets you easily distinguish the executable Euphoria files from the 
    include files. Thanks to Wolfgang Fritz.
    
* Out-of-bounds floating-point subscript values 
    were being reported after rounding down to an integer. 
    Now the value before rounding is reported. 
  
* **Euphoria Database System (EDS)**:
    **db_rename_table()** now checks to see
    if the target table name already exists, before it renames a table.
    Thanks to Mike Nelson.

* The first value returned by **rand()**
    (in the absence of **set_rand()**)
    is now more "random". Thanks to Yuku Sugianto. 
  


=== Bug Fixes


* **bug fixed**: Due to a change made in
    2.4 alpha, the **dir()** routine 
    for Borland and Lcc was concatenating the file attributes 
    characters (if any)  to the file name field. 
    Thanks to Dr. Juan R. Herguijuela.
    
* **bug fixed**: No error message was
    issued when ',' was followed immediately by ')' in a routine's parameter
    declaration list. Thanks to Brage Moris.
  
* **bug fixed**: Huge positive out-of-bounds
    subscripts (over 2 billion) were reported as huge negative values. 
    
* **bug fixed**:
    **repeat(0, size)**, where size was a
    huge positive floating-point number, incorrectly reported:
    "repetition count must not be negative". Now it reports:
    "repetition count is too large". Thanks to Martin Stachon.

* **bug fixed**:
    **machine_proc(x, 5)**, where x was a huge 
    floating-point number, incorrectly reported:
    "an integer was expected, not a sequence".
    Now it reports: "The first argument to machine_proc/func must be a small
    positive integer". Thanks to Martin Stachon.
