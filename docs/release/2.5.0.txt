== Version 2.5 Official Release March 8, 2005:

=== Enhanced Features

* The Source Code Product now includes the C code for interactive
  trace/debug and profiling. This was not provided in any previous release.
* **Translator**: A new **-fastfp** 
  option has been added for WATCOM/DOS (registered version only). 
  This option can double the speed of a floating-point intensive, 
  translated/compiled, program. The resulting .exe file requires a 
  Pentium class CPU, or a 386/486 with floating-point hardware.
* **eu.ex**: execute.e now uses call-back machine code supplied by 
  Matthew Lewis. As a result, there is no longer a limit on the number 
  of call-backs a program can use.
* **Translator**: There is now a **-keep** option that prevents the deletion 
  of any C files or object files created during translation. Thanks to Matthew 
  Lewis.
* **Translator**: In order to handle huge programs without exceeding the limits of 
  the C compiler, the translator will split init_.c into several pieces. Thanks to 
  Matthew Lewis.
* **Translator**: Better checking is provided for incorrect command-line options.
* **Translator**:  The translator avoids creating any files until it confirms that a 
  valid source file has been provided on the command line, or via the interactive 
  prompt.
* **ed.ex**: **ed** will only call free_console() at the end of execution
  on Linux or FreeBSD. It was causing a slight screen flicker on DOS/Windows, 
  and was not necessary.

=== Bug Fixes

* **bug fixed**: The error traceback from a bound or shrouded program had garbage showing 
  for the file names and line numbers. This bug was introduced in the beta release.
* **bug fixed**: Bound or shrouded programs were not starting off with a fresh random seed 
  value. Normal interpreted or translated programs were OK. Thanks to Michael Bolin.
* **bug fixed**: The error traceback could be wrong if you (illegally) tried to pass a 
  sequence as the routine id for call_proc/func. Thanks to Mario Steele.
* **bug fixed**: When displaying a large variable value during interactive trace, the first 
  few lines might be printed in white, while the rest was printed in bright white.
  Thanks to Al Getz.
* **bug fixed**: routine_id() of the form: routine_id("namespace:name") was not working 
  correctly in the interpreter or in the PD source interpreter. The Translator was ok. 
  This worked fine in 2.4 and earlier. Thanks to Verne Tice.
* **bug fixed**: command_line() now shows the extra file name when the user types the file 
  name interactively at the ex/exw/exu prompt. This is now compatible with 2.4 and earlier.
  Thanks to Bob Elia.
* **bug fixed**: Warnings were not getting reported when a program ended with a call to abort(),
  or it ended with a fatal run-time error. Thanks to Juergen Luethje.
* **bug fixed**: The platform() function is now evaluated in backend/backendw/backendu for .il 
  files (rather than in the front-end of the shrouder). This allows a .il file to be 
  portable to multiple platforms. In other situations, the interpreter 
  and translator will continue to evaluate platform() in the front-end 
  for maximum efficiency. Thanks to Ken Rhodes

=== Documentation

* Many small corrections and improvements were made to the documentation.
  Some important ones were provided by Juergen Luethje and Wolfgang Fritz.
* A paragraph was added to the Reference Manual explaining what happens
  when you try to modify a variable by function side-effects at the
  same time that you try to modify it via subscripted assignment.
  The 2.5 alpha release notes were updated to point out an
  incompatibility with 2.4.
