== Version 2.2 beta-test release for Linux October 22, 1999:

//Most of these features and bug fixes will also be made available 
in Version 2.2 for **WIN32 + DOS32**//. 

* **platform()** has been moved from misc.e into exu to eliminate 
the function call overhead. platform() now takes zero time to compute.
The compiler simply plugs in the appropriate constant value.
*  **lock_file()** 
 and **unlock_file()** have been added 
 to allow multiple processes
 to share access to files. This can be important in CGI programming and
 other areas.
* **flush()** will force the contents of the memory buffer out to a file or device.
* **chdir()** will change to a new current directory and let you know if it
was successful.
* **sleep()** will suspend execution of your program for a number of seconds,
and let the operating system schedule another process.
* **put_screen_char()** will write a character and its attributes (colors etc.)
to the screen.
* **get_screen_char()** will read a character and its attributes from the screen.
* **save_text_image()** now works on Linux (as well as DOS32). It copies
a rectangular text image from the screen.
* **display_text_image()** now works under Linux (as well as DOS32). 
It writes a rectangular text image to the screen.
  
* The "short-circuit" warning now gives the filename and line number of the 
  possibly short-circuited call. Minor clarifications were made in some 
  other error messages as well.
* Minor improvements were made to **ed** and **search**.
* A portability problem in **how2reg.ex** was fixed.
* **exu** is compressed better. It's actually a bit smaller now,
although functionality has been added to it.
