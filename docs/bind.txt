== Shrouding and Binding
:<<LEVELTOC level=2 depth=4>>

=== The eushroud Command

==== Synopsis

{{{
eushroud [-full_debug] [-list] [-quiet] [-out shrouded_file] filename.ex[w/u]
}}}

The **##eushroud##** command converts a Euphoria program, typically consisting of a 
main file plus many include files, into a single, compact file. A single file is
easier to distribute, and it allows you to distribute your program to others without 
releasing your source code.

A shrouded file does not contain any Euphoria source code statements. Rather,
it contains a low-level **Intermediate Language** (IL) that is executed by the
back-end of the interpreter. A shrouded file does not require any parsing. It
starts running immediately, and with large programs you will see a quicker
start-up time. Shrouded files must be run using the interpreter back-end:

##eubw.exe## (//Windows//) or ##eub.exe##
(//Unix//).  

This backend is freely available, and you can give it to
any of your users who need it. It is stored in ##.../euphoria/bin## in the Euphoria
interpreter package. You can run your ##.il## file with:

On //Windows// use:

{{{
eub myprog.il
eubw myprog.il
}}}

On //Unix// use:

{{{
eub myprog.il
}}}

Although it does not contain any source statements, a ##.il## file will generate a 
useful ##ex.err## dump in case of a run-time error.

The shrouder will remove any routines and variables that your program doesn't 
use. This will give you a smaller ##.il## file. There are often a great number of 
unused routines and unused variables. For example, your program might include 
several third party include files, plus some standard files from 
##.../euphoria/include##, but only use a few items from each file. The unused items 
will be deleted.

==== Options

* **-full_debug**: Make a somewhat larger ##.il## file that contains enough debug 
information to provide a full ##ex.err## dump when a crash occurs. Normally, 
variable names and line-number information is stripped out of the ##.il## file, so 
the ##ex.err## will simply have "no-name" where each variable name should be, 
and line numbers will only be accurate to the start of a routine or the start of
a file. Only the private variable values are shown, not the global or local 
values. In addition to saving space, some people might prefer that the shrouded
file, and any ##ex.err## file, not expose as much information.
* **-list**: Produce a listing in **deleted.txt** of the routines and constants 
that were deleted.
* **-quiet**: Suppress normal messages and statistics. Only report errors.
* **-out shrouded_file**: Write the output to ##shrouded_file##.

The Euphoria interpreter will not perform tracing on a shrouded file. You must
trace your original source.

On //Unix//, the shrouder will make your shrouded file executable,
and will add a ##!## line at the top, that will run ##eub.exe.## You
can override this ##!## line by specifying your own ##!##
line at the top of your main Euphoria file.

Always keep a copy of your original source. There is no way to recover it from a 
shrouded file.

=== The Bind Command

==== Synopsis:

{{{
eubind [-c config-file] [-con] [-copyright] [-eub path-to-backend] 
       [-full_debug] [-i dir] [-icon file] [-list] [-quiet] 
       [-out executable_file] [-shroud_only [filename.ex]
}}}


##eubind## does the same thing as ##eushroud##, and
includes the same options. It then combines your shrouded ##.il## file with the
interpreter backend (##eub.exe##, ##eubw.exe## or ##eub##) to make
a **single, stand-alone executable** file that you can conveniently use and
distribute. Your users need not have Euphoria installed.  Each time your
executable file is run, a quick integrity check is performed to detect any
tampering or corruption. Your program will start up very quickly since no
parsing is needed.

The Euphoria interpreter will not perform tracing on a bound file since the
source statements are not there.

==== Options:

* **-c config-file**: A Euphoria config file to use when binding.
* **-con**: **(//Windows// only)**: This option will create a //Windows// 
console program instead of a //Windows// GUI program. Console programs can 
access standard input and output, and they work within the current console 
window, rather than popping up a new one.
* **-eub path-to-backend** Allows specification of the backend runner to use
instead of the default, installed version.
* **-full_debug**: Same as ##eushroud## above. If Euphoria detects an error, your 
executable will generate either a partial, or a full, ##ex.err## dump, according
to this option.
* **-i dir**: A directory to add to the paths to use for searching for included 
files.
* **-icon filename[.ico]**: **(//Windows// only)** When you bind a program, you 
can patch in your own customized icon, overwriting the one in ##euiw.exe##. 
##eui.exe## contains a 32x32 icon using 256 colors. It resembles an **E)** 
shape. //Windows// will display this shape beside ##euiw.exe##, and beside your 
bound program, in file listings. You can also load this icon as a resource, 
using the name "euiw" (see ##...\euphoria\demo\win32\window.exw## for an example). 
When you bind your program, you can substitute your own 32x32 256-color icon 
file of size 2238 bytes or less. Other dimensions may also work as long as the 
file is 2238 bytes or less. The file must contain a single icon image 
(//Windows// will create a smaller or larger image as necessary). The default 
##euphoria.ico##, is included in the ##...\euphoria\bin## directory.
* **-list**: Same as ##shroud## above.
* **-quiet**: Same as ##shroud## above.
* **-out executable_file**: This option lets you choose the name of the 
executable file created by the binder. Without this option, ##eubind## will 
choose a name based on the name of the main Euphoria source file.

A one-line Euphoria program will result in an executable file as large as the
back-end you are binding with, but the size increases very slowly as you add to
your program. **When bound, the entire Euphoria editor,
##ed.ex##, adds only 27K to the size of the back-end.** 

The first two items returned by [[:command_line]] will be
slightly different when your program is bound. See the procedure description for
the details.

A **bound executable** file //can// handle standard input and output 
redirection as with this syntax:

{{{
myprog.exe < file.in > file.out
}}}

If you were to write a small ##.bat## file, say ##myprog.bat##, that contained 
the line "##eui myprog.ex##" you would //not// be able to redirect input and 
output. The following will not work:

{{{
myprog.bat < file.in > file.out
}}}

You //could// however use redirection on individual lines //within// the 
##.bat## file.
