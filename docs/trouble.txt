If you get stuck, here are some things you can do:

# Type: ##guru## followed by some keywords associated with your problem. For 
example, ##guru declare global include##
# Check the list of common problems ([[:Common Problems and Solutions]]).
# Read the relevant parts of the documentation, i.e. 
[[:toc|Euphoria Programming Language v4.0]] or [[:API Reference]].
# Try running your program with trace:
<eucode>
with trace
trace(1)
</eucode>

=== Common Problems and Solutions

Here are some commonly reported problems and their solutions.

==== Console window disappeared

//I ran my program with ##euiw.exe## and the console window disappeared
before I could read the output.//

The console window will only appear if required, and will disappear immediately 
when your program finishes execution. Perhaps you should code something like:

<eucode>
puts(1, "\nPress Enter\n")
if getc(0) then
end if
</eucode>
at the end of your program.

You may also run your console program with ##eui.exe##.

==== Press Enter

//At the end of execution of my program, I see "Press Enter" and I have to hit 
the Enter key. How do I get rid of that?//

Call [[:free_console]] just before your program terminates.

<eucode>
include dll.e

free_console()
</eucode>

==== CGI Program Hangs / No Output

//My Euphoria CGI program hangs or has no output//

# Make sure that you are using the ##-batch## parameter to ##eui##. This causes 
Euphoria to not present the normal "Press any key to continue..." prompt when a 
warning or error occurs. The web server will not respond to this prompt and your
application will hang waiting for ENTER to be pressed.
# Use the ##-wf## parameter to write all warnings to a file instead of the 
console. The warnings that Euphoria will write to the console may interfere with 
the actual output of your web content.
# Look for an ex.err file in your cgi-bin directory. Turn on 
##with trace## / ##trace(3)## to see  what statements are executed (see 
##ctrace.out## in your cgi-bin). On //Windows// you should always use ##eui.exe##
to run CGI programs, or you may have problems with standard output. With
Apache Web Server, you can have a first line in your program of:
#!.\eui.exe to run your program using eui.exe in the current (cgi-bin)
directory. Be careful that your first line ends with the line breaking characters
appropriate for your platform, or the ##!## won't be handled correctly. You 
must also set the execute permissions on your program correctly, and ##ex.err## 
and ctrace.out must be writable by the server process or they won't be updated.


==== Read / Write Ports?

//How do I read/write ports?//

There are collections of machine-level routines from the
[[http://www.rapideuphoria.com|Euphoria Web Page]].

==== Program has no errors, no output

//When I run my program there are no errors but nothing happens.//

You probably forgot to call your main procedure. You need
a top-level statement that comes after your main procedure to call the
main procedure and start execution.

==== Routine not declared

//I'm trying to call a routine documented in ##library.doc##, but it keeps
saying the routine has not been declared.//

Did you remember to include the necessary ##.e## file from the 
##euphoria\include## directory? If the syntax of the routine says for example,
"##include\std\graphics.e##", then your program must have 
"##include\std\graphics.e##" (without the quotes) before the place where you 
first call the routine.

==== Routine not declared, my file

//I have an include file with a routine in it that I want to call, but when I
try to call the routine it says the routine has not been declared. But it 
**has** been declared.//

Did you remember to define the routine as ##public##, ##export## or possibly 
##global##? If not, the routine is not visible outside of its own file.

==== After user input, left margin problem

//After inputting a string from the user with ##gets##, the next line that 
comes out on the screen does not start at the left margin.//

Your program should output a //new-line// character e.g.

<eucode>
input = gets()
puts(SCREEN, '\n')
</eucode>

==== Floating-point calculations not exact

//Why aren't my floating-point calculations coming out exact?//

Intel CPU's, and most other CPU's, use binary numbers to represent
fractions. Decimal fractions such as 0.1, 0.01 and
similar numbers can't be represented precisely. For example, 0.1 might
be stored internally as ##0.0999999999999999## . That means that ##10 * 0.1##
might come out as ##0.999999999999999##, and ##floor(10 * 0.1)## might be ##0##,
not ##1## as you would expect. This can be a nuisance when you are dealing
with money calculations, but it is not a Euphoria problem. It's a
general problem that you must face in most programming languages.
Always remember: floating-point numbers are just an approximation
to the "real" numbers in mathematics. Assume that any floating-point calculation
might have a tiny bit of error in the result. Sometimes you can
solve the problem by rounding, e.g. x = round( x, 100 ) would round
x off to the nearest hundredth.  Storing money values as an integer
number of pennies, rather than a fractional number of dollars
(or similar currency) will help, but some calculations could still
cause problems.



==== Number to a string?

//How do I convert a number to a string?//

Use [[:sprintf]]:

<eucode>
string = eu:sprintf("%d", 10) -- string is "10"
</eucode>

or use [[:number]]:

<eucode>
include std/locale.e as locale
string = locale:number(10) 
         -- string is probably "10.00" if called in the U.S.
         -- It depends on the locale preferences set on your computer.
</eucode>

Number formats according to the locale setting on your computer and
strangely, this means to give you two decimal places whether or not
you supply an integer value for the U.S. locale.

Besides ##%d##, you can also try other formats, such as
##%x## (Hex) or ##%f## (floating-point).

==== String to a number?

//How do I convert a string to a number?//

Use [[:value]].

==== Redefine my for-loop variable?

//It says I'm attempting to redefine my for-loop variable.//

For-loop variables are declared automatically. Apparently you already have a
declaration with the same name earlier in your routine or your program.
Remove that earlier declaration or change the name of your loop variable.

==== Unknown Escape Character

//I get the message "unknown escape character" on a line where I am trying
to specify a file name.//

**Do not** say ##"C:\TMP\MYFILE"##. You need to say ##"C:~\~\TMP~\~\MYFILE"## 
or use back-quotes ##`C:~\TMP~\MYFILE`##.

Backslash is used for escape characters such as ##\n## or ##\t##. To specify a 
single backslash in a string you need to type ##~\~\##. Therefore, say 
##"C:~\~\TMP~\~\MYFILE"## instead of ##"C:\TMP\MYFILE"##

==== Only first character in printf

//I'm trying to print a string using [[:printf]] but only the first character
comes out.//

You need to put braces around the parameters sequence to [[:printf]]. You
probably wrote:

<eucode>
printf(1, "Hello, %s!\n", mystring)
</eucode>

but you need:

<eucode>
printf(1, "Hello, %s!\n", {mystring})
</eucode>

==== Only 10 significant digits during printing

//When I print numbers using [[:printf]] or [[:? ->q_print]] only 10 significant
digits are displayed.//

Euphoria normally only shows about 10 digits. Internally, all
calculations are performed using at least 15 significant digits. To see
more digits you have to use [[:printf]]. For example,

<eucode>
printf(1, "%.15f", 1/3)
</eucode>

This will display 15 digits.

==== A type is expected here

//It complains about my routine declaration, saying, "a type is expected
here."//

When declaring subroutine parameters, Euphoria requires you to
provide an explicit type for each individual parameter. e.g.

<eucode>
procedure foo(integer x, y)         -- WRONG
procedure foo(integer x, integer y) -- RIGHT
</eucode>

In all other contexts it is ok to make a list:

<eucode>
atom a, b, c, d, e
</eucode>

==== Expected to see...

//It says: ##Syntax Error - expected to see possibly 'xxx', not 'yyy'##//

At this point in your program you have typed a variable, keyword, number or
punctuation symbol, yyy, that does not fit syntactically with what has come
before it. The compiler is offering you one example, xxx, of something that
would be accepted at this point in place of yyy. Note that there may be many
other legal (and much better) possibilities at this point than xxx, but xxx
might at least give you a clue as to what the compiler is "thinking."
