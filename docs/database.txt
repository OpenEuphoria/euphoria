== Euphoria Database System (EDS)
:<<LEVELTOC level=2 depth=4>>

=== Introduction  

While you can connect Euphoria to most databases 
(MySQL, SQLite, PostgreSQL, etc.), sometimes you don't need that kind
of power. The **Euphoria Database System** (EDS) is a simple, easy-to-use, 
flexible, Euphoria-oriented database for storing data that works better for 
cases where you need more than a text file and don't quite need or want the
power and complexity of larger database packages.
 
=== EDS Database Structure

In EDS, a **database** is "a single file with a ##.edb## file extension."  An EDS
database contains zero or more **tables**. Each table has a **name**, and 
contains zero or more **records**.  Each record consists of a **key** part, and 
a **data** part. The key can be //any// Euphoria object~--an atom, a sequence, a
deeply-nested sequence, whatever. Similarly the data can be //any// Euphoria
object.  There are //no// constraints on the size or structure of the key or
data. Within a given table, the keys are all unique. That is, no two records in
the same table can have the same key part.
 
The records of a table are stored in ascending order of key value.  An
efficient binary search is used when you refer to a record by key. You can also
access a record directly, with no search, if you know its current 
**record number** within the table. Record numbers are integers from one to the 
length (current number of records) of the table. By incrementing the record 
number, you can efficiently step through all the records, in order of key. 
Note however that a record's number can change whenever a new record is 
inserted, or an existing record is deleted.

The keys and data parts are stored in a compact form, but //no// accuracy is 
lost when saving or restoring floating-point numbers or //any// other Euphoria 
data.

##std/eds.e## will work as is, on all platforms. EDS database files can be 
copied and shared between programs running on all platforms as well. When 
sharing EDS database files, be sure to make an exact byte-for-byte copy using 
"binary" mode copying, rather than "text" or "ASCII" mode, which could change 
the line terminators.
 
Example:

{{{
database: "mydata.edb"
    first table: "passwords"
        record #1:  key: "jones"   data: "euphor123"
        record #2:  key: "smith"   data: "billgates"
        
    second table: "parts"
        record #1:  key: 134525    data: {"hammer", 15.95, 500}
        record #2:  key: 134526    data: {"saw", 25.95, 100}
        record #3:  key: 134530    data: {"screw driver", 5.50, 1500}
}}}

It's up to you to interpret the meaning of the key and data. //In keeping with
the spirit of Euphoria, you have total flexibility.// Unlike most other
database systems, an EDS record is //not// required to have either a fixed 
number of fields, or fields with a preset maximum length.
 
In many cases there will not be any natural key value for your records.  In
those cases you should simply create a meaningless, but unique, integer to be
the key. Remember that you can always access the data by record number. It's
easy to loop through the records looking for a particular field value.

=== Accessing Data

To reduce the number of parameters that you have to pass, there is a notion of
the **current database**, and **current table**. 

==== Current Database.

Any data operation or table operation assumes there is a current database being 
defined. You set the current database by opening, creating or selecting a 
database. Deleting the current database leaves the current database undefined.

==== Current Table.

All data operations assume there is a current table being defined. You must 
create, select or rename a table in order to make it current. Deleting the 
current table leaves the current table undefined.

==== Accessing Data

Most routines use these
//current// values automatically.  You normally start by opening (or creating)
a database file, then selecting the table that you want to work with.
 
You can map a key to a record number using [[:db_find_key]]. It uses an
efficient binary search. Most of the other record-level routines expect the
record number as a parameter. You can very quickly access any record, given
it's number. You can access all the records by starting at record number one and
looping through to the record number returned by [[:db_table_size]].
 
=== Storage Recycling

When you delete something, such as a record, the space for that item gets put
on a free list, for future use. Adjacent free areas are combined into larger
free areas. When more space is needed, and no suitable space is found on the
free list, the file will grow in size.  Currently there is no automatic way
that a file will shrink in size, but you can use a
[[:db_compress]] to completely rewrite a
database, removing the unused spaces.

=== Security and Multi-user Access

This release provides a simple way to lock an entire database to prevent unsafe
access by other processes.

=== Scalability

Internal pointers are 4 bytes. In theory that limits the size of a database
file to 4 Gb. In practice, the limit is 2 Gb because of limitations in 
various C file functions used by Euphoria.  Given enough user demand, EDS 
databases could be expanded well beyond 2 Gb in the future.
 
The current algorithm allocates four bytes of memory per record in the current
table. So you will need at least 4 Mb RAM per million records on disk.
 
The binary search for keys should work reasonably well for large tables. 
 
Inserts and deletes take slightly longer as a table gets larger. 
 
At the low end of the scale, it's possible to create extremely small databases
without incurring much disk space overhead.

=== EDS API

More details on using EDS, including complete coverage of the EDS API, can be 
found at [[:Euphoria Database (EDS)]].

=== Disclaimer

Do not store valuable data without a backup.  RDS will not be responsible for
any damage or data loss.

=== Warning: Use Binary File Mode

##.edb## files are binary files, not text files.  You **must** use ##BINARY## 
mode when
transferring a ##.edb## file via FTP from one machine to another. You must also
avoid loading a ##.edb## file into an editor and saving it. If you open a 
##.edb## file directly using Euphoria's ##open##, which is not recommended, 
you must use binary
mode, not text mode.  Failure to follow these rules could result in 10
(line-feed) and 13 (carriage-return) bytes being changed, leading to subtle and
not-so-subtle forms of corruption in your database.
