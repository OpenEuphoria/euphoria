== Unsupported Features

:<<LEVELTOC level=2 depth=4>>

These are features that have been implemented either partly
or fully, but are not officially part of the Euphoria Language. They may
one day be officially sanctioned and thus fully supported, but that is
not certain. And even if an unsupported feature does make it way into
the language, it may not be exactly what is documented in this section.

So if you use **any** of these unsupported featues then be aware that your code
might break in future releases.

=== UTF Encoded String Literals

* using word strings hexadecimal (for utf-16) and double word hexadecimal 
(for utf-32)  e.g.

<eucode>
u"65 66 67 AE" -- ==> {#65,#66,#67,#AE}
U"65 66 67 AE" -- ==> {#65,#66,#67,#AE}
</eucode>

The value of the strings above are equivalent.  
Spaces seperate values to other elements.  
When you put too many hex characters together for the kind of string they are
split up appropriately for you:

<eucode>
x"6566 67AE"  -- 8-bit  ==> {#65,#66,#67,#AE}
u"6566 67AE"  -- 16-bit ==> {#6566,#67AE}
U"6566 67AE"  -- 32-bit ==> {#6566,#67AE}
U"6566_67AE"  -- 32-bit ==> {#656667AE} 
              --            Uses '_' to aid readability for long values.
U"656667AE"   -- 32-bit ==> {#656667AE}
</eucode>

String literals encoded as ASCII, UTF-8, UTF-16, UTF-32 or really any encoding
that uses elements that are 32-bits long or shorter can be built with U"" 
syntax.
Literals of encodings that have 16-bit long or shorter or 8-bit long or shorter
elements can be built using u"" syntax or x"" syntax  respectively.  
Use delimiters, such as spaces and underscores, to break the ambiguity and
improve readability. 

The following is code with a vaild UTF8 encoded string:

<eucode>
sequence utf8_val = x"3e 65" -- This is ">e"
</eucode>

**However,** it is up to the coder to know the correct code-point values for
these to make any sense in the encoding the coder is using. That is to say,
it is possible for the coder to use the x"", u"", and U"" syntax to create
literals that are **not valid** UTF strings.

Hexadecimal strings can be used to encode UTF-8 strings, even though the 
resulting string does not have to be a valid UTF-8 string. 

**The rules for unicode strings are...**

# they begin with the pair ##u"## for UTF-16 and ##U"## for UTF-32 strings, and
 end with a double-quote (##"##) character
# they can only contain hexadecimal digits (0-9 A-F a-f), and space, underscore,
 tab, newline, carriage-return. Anything else is invalid.
# an underscore is simply ignored, as if it was never there. It is used to aid
 readability.
# For UTF-16 strings, each set of four contiguous hex digits represent a single 
sequence element with a value from 0x0000 to 0xFFFF
# For UTF-32 strings, each set of eight contiguous hex digits represent a single
sequence element with a value from 0x0000 to 0xFFFFFFFF
# they can span multiple lines
# The non-hex digits are treated as punctuation and used to delimit individual 
  values.
# The resulting string does not have to be a valid UTF-16/UTF-32 string.

<eucode>
u"1 2 34 5678AbC" == {0x0001, 0x0002, 0x0034, 0x5678, 0x0ABC}
U"1 2 34 5678AbC" == {0x0000_0001, 0x0000_0002, 0x0000_0034, 0x05678ABC}
U"1 2 34 5_678_AbC" == {0x0000_0001, 0x0000_0002, 0x0000_0034, 0x0567_8ABC}
