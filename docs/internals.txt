== Euphoria Internals ==

The interpreter has four binary components:
* Interpreter
* Translator
* Backend  
* Library

The Euphoria interpreter has two parts: the frontend and the backend. The
**frontend** is a parser that converts source-code into a set of
**Intermediate Language** (IL) instructions. The **backend** then takes the
IL instructions and executes the program.

When the //interpreter// executes source-code, the frontend parses and prepares
the code, and then the backend executes the code.

When the //shrouder// executes source-code, only the frontend is run producing
an ##.il## file. This ##.il## file may be run by the backend as an
independent step to execute the program.

When the //binder// executes source-code, the ##.il## instructions produced
by the frontend are combined with the backend to produce a stand-alone
executable program. The executable program may then be run independetly at any
time.

When the //translator// executes source-code, the ##.il## instructions are
translated into C-code. This C-code is compiled with an installed C compiler
producing an executable program.

The //library// is called by the backend for the many builtins included in 
Euphoria.

=== The Euphoria Data Structures ===

==== The Euphoria representation of a Euphoria Object =====

Every Euphoria object is stored as-is.  A special unlikely floating point value 
is used for ##NOVALUE##.  ##NOVALUE## signifies that a variable has not been 
assigned a value or the end of a sequence.

==== The C Representation of a Euphoria Object =====

Every Euphoria object is either stored as is, or as an encoded pointer.  A 
Euphoria ##integer## is stored in a 32-bit signed integer.  If the number is too
big for a Euphoria ##integer##, it is assigned to a 64-bit double float in a 
structure and an encoded pointer to that structure is stored in the said 32-bit 
memory space.  Sequences are stored in a similar way.

Euphoria integers are stored in object variables as-is.  An object variable is a
four byte signed integer.  Legal integer values for Euphoria integers are 
between -1,073,741,824 ( -2^^30^^ ) and +1,073,741,823 ( 2^^30^^-1 ).
Unsigned hexadecimal numbers from C000_0000 to FFFF_FFFF are the negative 
integers and numbers from 0000_0000 to 3FFF_FFFF are the positive integers.  The
hexadecimal values not used as integers are thus 4000_0000 to BFFF_FFFF.  Other 
values are for encoded pointers.  Pointers are always 8 byte aligned.  So a 
pointer is stored in 29-bits instead of 32 and can fit in a hexadecimal range 
0x2000_0000 long. The pointers are encoded in such a way that their encoded values 
will never be in the range of the integers. Pointers to sequence structures 
(struct s1) are encoded into a range between 8000_0000 to 9FFF_FFFF.  Pointers 
to structures for doubles (struct d) are encoded into a range between A000_0000 
to BFFF_FFFF. A special value NOVALUE is at the end of the range of encoded 
pointers is BFFF_FFFF and it signifies that there is no value yet assigned to a 
variable and it also signifies the end of a sequence.  In C, values of this type
are stored in the 'object' type.  The range 4000_0000 to 7FFF_FFFF is unused.

A double structure 'struct d' could indeed contain a value that is legally in 
the range of a Euphoria integer.  So the encoded pointer to this structure is 
recognized by the interpreter as an 'integer' but in this internals document 
when we say Euphoria integer we mean it actually is a C integer in the legal 
Euphoria integer range.


=== The C Representations of a Euphoria Sequence and a Euphoria Atom =====

{{{
// Sequence Header 
struct s1
{
 object_ptr base;     // base is such that base[1] is the first element
 long length;         // this is the sequence length
 long ref;            // ref is the number of as virtual copies of this sequence
 long postfill;       // is how many extra objects could fit at the end of base
 cleanup_ptr cleanup; // this is a pointer to a Euphoria routine that is run 
                      // just before the sequence is freed.
}

}}}

However, we allocate more than this structure.  Inside the allocated data but past the structure,
there also is 
an area of 'pre free space'; sequence data pointed to by base[1] to base[$], $ being the length;
a NOVALUE terminator for the sequence, 
and an area of post fill space.  In memory, immediately following the structure there is the following data stored:

{{{
 object pre_fill_space[]; // could have 0 (not exist) or more elements before used data
 object base[1..$];       // sequence members pointed to by base
 object base[$+1];        // a magic number terminating the sequence members (NOVALUE)
 object post_fill_space[];// could have 0 (not exist) or more elements after used data
}}} 

Taken together these are what get represented in memory.
|  base  | length |   ref  |postfill| cleanup|  pre fill space | base[1..$] | ##NOVALUE## | post fill space  |

By their nature, sequences are variable length, dynamic entities and so the C structure needs to
cater for this. When a sequence is created, we allocate enough RAM for the combined header and the
initial storage for the elements. 

|= Field    |= Description |
|  base     | This contains the address of the first element less the
              length of one element. Thus ##base[1]## points to the first
              element and ##base[0]## points to a fictitious element just
              before the first one, which is never used.\\
              Initially, ##base## contains the address of the last member of
              the sequence header but 
              as the sequence is resized, it can point to the last member or anywhere after.
|  length   | Contains the current number of elements in the sequence.
|  ref      | Contains the count of references to this sequence. Only when
              this is zero, can the RAM used by the sequence be returned to
              the system for reuse. 
|  postfill | The size of 'post fill space' in element spaces.  Rather than using bytes,
              postfill is measured in objects which are each address wide elements.  
              If this is non-zero, we can append to
              the sequence with at most ##postfill## new elements before needing
              to reallocate RAM.\\
|  cleanup  | If not null, it points to a routine that is called immediately before
              the sequence is deleted.\\
| pre fill space | There are 0 or more spaces before base[1].  We can calculate
              the free space in *objects* at the front of a sequence, s1, in C by\\ 
              ##(&s1.base[1] - (object_ptr)(1+&s1))##.\\  
              In EUPHORIA, you will have to divide by the size of a C_POINTER on the difference.
              When elements are removed from the front of a sequence, we simply
              adjust the address in ##base## to point to the new //first// element
              and reduce the ##length## count.  
              If we want to prepend and this pre fill space has some positive size, then we make room by decrementing ##base## and increment the ##length##.  The new data is then assigned to ##base##[1].
| base[1]..base[length] sequence data |      This is actual data.
| base[$+1]  |      This is always set to ##NOVALUE##.
| post fill space | There are 0 or more spaces after ##base##[##length##+1].  The number of spaces is stored in 
                    ##postfill##.  If ##postfill## is non-zero we can append by incrementing the ##length##, decrementing ##postfill## and assigning the new data to ##base##[$].
                    When we remove from the end of the sequence, we increment ##postfill## and
                    decrement the ##length##.


{{{
// Atom Header
struct d
{
 double dbl;          // the actual value of a double number.
 long ref;            // ref is the number of virtual copies of this double
 cleanup_ptr cleanup; // this is a pointer to a Euphoria routine that is run 
                      // just before the sequence is freed.
}
}}}


Now offset of the 'ref' in struct d must be the same as the offset of the 'ref' 
in struct s1.  To this end, the 64bit implementation of 4.1 has these members in a different order.

=== The Euphoria Object Macros and Functions ===

==== Description

The macros are imperfect.  For example, ##IS_SEQUENCE(NOVALUE)## returns 
##TRUE## and ##IS_ATOM_DBL()## will return ##TRUE## for integer values as well 
as encoded pointers to
'struct d's.   This is why there is an order that these tests are made: We test 
##IS_ATOM_INT## and if that fails we can use ##IS_ATOM_DBL## and then that will 
only be true if we pass an encoded pointer to a double.  We must be sure that 
something is not ##NOVALUE## before we use ##IS_SEQUENCE## on it.

// Often we know foo is not NOVALUE before getting into this://

{{{
// object foo
if (IS_ATOM_INT(foo)) {
 // some code for a Euphoria integer
} else if (IS_ATOM_DBL(foo)) {
 // some code for a double
} else {
 // code for a sequence foo
}
}}}

A sequence is held in a 'struct s1' type and a double is contained in a 
'struct d'.

@[:internals:NewS1|]
==== NewS1
<eucode>
<internal> object NewS1 ( long size )
</eucode>

===== Returns

=== Object Constants

Use MAXINT and MININT to check for overflow and underflow, NOVALUE to check if a 
variable has not
been assigned, and use NOVALUE to terminate a sequence.

@[:internals:NOVALUE|]
==== NOVALUE
<eucode>
<internal> object NOVALUE
</eucode>

Indicates that a variable has not been assigned and also terminates a sequence.

@[:internals:MININT|]
==== MININT
<eucode>
<internal> signed int MININT
</eucode>

The minimal Euphoria integer.  This is -(2^^30^^).


@[:internals:MAXINT|]
==== MAXINT
<eucode>
<internal> signed int MAXINT
</eucode>

The maximal Euphoria integer.  This is 2^^30^^-1.

@[:internals:HIGH_BITS|]
==== HIGH_BITS
<eucode>
<internal> signed int HIGH_BITS
</eucode>

HIGH_BITS is an integer value such that if another integer value c lies outside of the range 
between MININT and MAXINT, c+HIGH_BITS will be non-negative.

===== Proof that HIGH_BITS is #C000_0000 on 32-bit version of EUPHORIA.
   *In the following expressions powers have higher precedence than unuary minus.*
   if c is a non-ATOM-INT value, then
   
   c belongs to the set  [-2^^31^^,-2^^30^^-1(=NOVALUE)] U [2^^30^^,2^^31^^].
   
   c+-2^^30^^ belongs to the set  [-2^^31^^-2^^30^^,-2^^30^^-1-2^^30^^] U [2^^30^^-2^^30^^,2^^30^^]
    which is [-3*2^^30^^,-2^^31^^-1] U [0,2^^30^^].  However the lower values wrap around 
    to non-negative numbers:
    
   -2^^31^^-1 wraps to 2^^31^^-1.  -3*2^^30^^ wraps around to 2^^30^^.
   
   c+-2^^30^^ belongs to the set  [2^^30^^,2^^31^^-1] U [0,2^^30^^] = [0,2^^31^^-1]
   
   This is the set of all non-negative numbers that can fit into 32-bit signed
   longs.  -2^^30^^ is the unsigned version of #C000_0000.  QED.
   
   A visual way of looking at it is, adding #C000_0000 to the set of non-ATOM_INTS 
   rotates the set to the negative side by -MININT (2^30).  The already negative ones wrap 
   around to the positive; the positive numbers stay positive and hug the zero.  
   Since adding #C000_0000 on registers is 1-1 and onto, we also know that ATOM_INTs
   will all be mapped to negative signed longs.
   
   
===== Testing for Overflow:
    There are two ways to test for overflow:
    	# (c > MAXINT) || (c < MININT)
        # (c + HIGH_BITS) >= 0
        
==== Parser

Inserting tokens into the token buffer is the easiest way to add features to the EUPHORIA parser.
The tokens are two-element sequences one of the class of token and the other the token's value:
 
 {<class>,<value>}
 
Each of the class values are capitalized words for some keyword or VARIABLE.  
The list of constants is in reswords.e.  Often it is enough to only examin the class.
In the case of variables, it is important to know which variable.
In this case the second element, comes into play.

You can use putback() to put tokens into the token buffer.  The tokens will be pulled out
by the parser in a filo manner, like a stack.  

==== Backend Instructions

After the Parser processes the instructions.  It creates Backend instructions that
are easily translated or interpreted.  The system uses opcodes and some parameters which
are put on a stack.  This backend language is similar to assembler.  You have
opcodes (instructions) and parameters.  These parameters must be integers themselves but
some may serve as pointers to arbitrary EUPHORIA objects.  As a developer of EUPHORIA itself,
rather than a developer that uses EUPHORIA, it is important to know exactly what these
opcodes do and what they are for.  In this section we will document what they are for,
and how they manipulate the instruction pointer, and stack.


IF instruction:

The IF instruction is used for making runtime branch statements.  The IF instruction takes
the top of the stack as the condition value, if the condition is 0, it passes control to
the address stored just below the top of the stack.  If the condition is non-zero and
an atom the instruction pointer just past the failure address.

[ IF instruction ] [ test value ] [ failure address ]


INTEGER_CHECK instruction:

The INTEGER_CHECK is used to ensure that something has a value considered to be
'integer' to the EUPHORIA language definition.  The instruction takes the next argument as
a pointer to a value and determines whether this value is in the legal integer range,
regardless of how that number is represented.  If not in legal range, then 
the program ends execution in a type-check failure error message.

[ INTEGER_CHECK instruction ] [ test pointer ]

ATOM_CHECK instruction:

The ATOM_CHECK is used to determine whether something has a numeric value rather than
a sequence.  The instruction takes an argument as a pointer to a value and
determines whether the value is an atom.  If it is not an atom, then the program
ends execution in a type-check failure error message.

[ ATOM_CHECK instruction ] [ test pointer ]

IS_AN_INTEGER instruction:

The IS_AN_INTEGER instruction is used to determine whether something has a value considered to
be 'integer' to the EUPHORIA language definition.  The instruction takes the argument as 
a pointer to a value and determines whether this value is in the legal integer range, 
regardless of how that number is represented.  If it is in the 'integer' range then 
the value pointed by the second argument will be 1 otherwise it will be 0.
