== Multitasking in Euphoria
:<<LEVELTOC level=2 depth=4>>

=== Introduction

Euphoria allows you to set up multiple, independent tasks.  Each task has its
own current statement that it is executing, its own call stack, and its own set
of private variables.  Tasks run in parallel with each other. That is, before
any given task completes its work, other tasks can be given a chance to
execute.  Euphoria's task scheduler decides which task should be active at any
given time.

=== Why Multitask?

Most programs do not need to use multitasking and would not benefit from it.
However it is very useful in some cases:

* Action games where numerous characters, projectiles etc. need to be displayed 
in a realistic way, as if they are all independent of one another. Language War 
is a good example.
* Situations where your program must sometimes wait for input from a human or 
other computer. While one task in your program is waiting, another separate task
could be doing some computation, disk search, etc.
* All operating systems today have special API routines that let 
you initiate some I/O, and then proceed without waiting for it to finish. A task
could check periodically to see if the I/O is finished, while another task is 
performing some useful computation, or is perhaps starting another I/O operation.
* Situations where your program might be called upon to serve many users 
simultaneously. With multiple tasks, it's easy to keep track of the state of 
your interaction with all these separate users.
* Perhaps you can divide your program into two logical processes, and have a 
task for each. One produces data and stores it, while the other reads the data 
and processes it. Maybe the first process is time-critical, since it interacts 
with the user, while the second process can be executed during lulls in the 
action, where the user is thinking or doing something that doesn't require quick
response.

=== Types of Tasks

Euphoria supports two types of tasks: real-time tasks, and time-share tasks.

**Real-time tasks** are scheduled at intervals, specified by a number of
seconds or fractions of a second. You might schedule one real-time task to be
activated every 3 seconds, while another is activated every 0.1 seconds.  In
Language War, when the Euphoria ship moves at warp 4, or a torpedo flies across
the screen, it's important that they move at a steady, timed pace.

**Time-share tasks** need a share of the CPU but they needn't be rigidly
scheduled according to any clock.

It's possible to reschedule a task at any time, changing its timing or its
slice of the CPU. You can even convert a task from one type to the other
dynamically.

=== A Small Example

This example shows the main task (which all Euphoria programs start off
with) creating two additional real-time tasks. We call them real-time because
they are scheduled to get control every few seconds.

You should try copy/pasting and running this example.  You'll see that task 1
gets control every 2.5 to 3 seconds, while task 2 gets control every 5 to 5.1
seconds.  In between, the main task (task 0), has control as it checks for a
'q' character to abort execution.

<eucode>
constant TRUE = 1, FALSE = 0

type boolean(integer x)
	return x = 0 or x = 1
end type

boolean t1_running, t2_running

procedure task1(sequence message)
	for i = 1 to 10 do
		printf(1, "task1 (%d) %s\n", {i, message})
		task_yield()
	end for
	t1_running = FALSE
end procedure

procedure task2(sequence message)
	for i = 1 to 10 do
		printf(1, "task2 (%d) %s\n", {i, message})
		task_yield()
	end for
	t2_running = FALSE
end procedure

puts(1, "main task: start\n")

atom t1, t2

t1 = task_create(routine_id("task1"), {"Hello"})
t2 = task_create(routine_id("task2"), {"Goodbye"})

task_schedule(t1, {2.5, 3})
task_schedule(t2, {5, 5.1})

t1_running = TRUE
t2_running = TRUE

while t1_running or t2_running do
	if get_key() = 'q' then
		exit
	end if
	task_yield()
end while

puts(1, "main task: stop\n")
-- program ends when main task is finished
</eucode>

=== Comparison with earlier multitasking schemes

In earlier releases of Euphoria, Language War already had a mechanism for
multitasking, and some people submitted to User Contributions their own
multitasking schemes. These were all implemented using plain Euphoria code,
whereas this new multitasking feature is built into the interpreter. Under the
old Language War tasking scheme a scheduler would *call* a task, which would
eventually have to *return* to the scheduler, so it could then dispatch the
next task.

In the new system, a task can call the built-in procedure ##task_yield## at any
point, perhaps many levels deep in subroutine calls, and the scheduler, which
is now part of the interpreter, will be able to transfer control to any other
task. When control comes back to the original task, it will resume execution at
the statement after ##task_yield##, with its call stack and all private variables
intact. Each task has its own call stack, program counter (i.e. current
statement being executed), and private variables.  You might have several tasks
all executing a routine at the same time, and each task will have its own set
of private variable values for that routine. Global and local variables are
shared between tasks.

It's fairly easy to take any piece of code and run it as a task.  Just insert a
few ##task_yield## statements so it will not hog the CPU.

=== Comparison with multithreading

When people talk about threads, they are usually referring to a mechanism
provided by the operating system. That's why we prefer to use the term
"multitasking".  Threads are generally "preemptive", whereas Euphoria
multitasking is "cooperative". With preemptive threads, the operating system
can force a switch from one thread to another at virtually any time.  With
cooperative multitasking, each task decides when to give up the CPU and let
another task get control. If a task were "greedy" it could keep the CPU for
itself for long intervals. However since a program is written by one person or
group that wants the program to behave well, it would be silly for them to
favor one task like that.  They will try to balance things in a way that works
well for the user.  An operating system might be running many threads, and many
programs, that were written by different people, and it would be useful to
enforce a reasonable degree of sharing on these programs.  Preemption makes
sense across the whole operating system. It makes far less sense within one
program.

Furthermore, threading is notorious for causing subtle bugs.  Nasty things can
happen when a task loses control at just the wrong moment. It may have been
updating a global variable when it loses control and leaves that variable in an
inconsistent state.  Something as trivial as incrementing a variable can go
awry if a thread-switch happens at the wrong moment. e.g. consider two threads.
One has:

<eucode>
x = x + 1
</eucode>

and the other also has:

<eucode>
x = x + 1
</eucode>

At the machine level, the first task loads the value of x into a register, then
loses control to the second task which increments x and stores the result back
into x in memory. Eventually control goes back to the first task which also
increments x *using the value of x in the register*, and then stores it into x
in memory. So x has only been incremented once instead of twice as was
intended. To avoid this problem, each thread would need something like:

<eucode>
lock x
x = x + 1
unlock x
</eucode>

where lock and unlock would be special primitives that are safe for threading.
It's often the case that programmers forget to lock data, but their program
seems to run ok. Then one day, many months after they've written the code, the
program crashes mysteriously.

Cooperative multitasking is much safer, and requires far fewer expensive
locking operations. Tasks relinquish control at safe points once they have
completed a logical operation.
