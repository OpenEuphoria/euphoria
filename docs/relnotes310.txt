== Version 3.1 June 2007:
This release adds some new features, fixes some bugs, and improves the documentation.

=== New Features

<ul>
<li>
      New built-in routines, **find_from()** and **match_from()** 
      have been added.
      These work like find() and match() but they let you start searching
      from any element in the sequence, not necessarily at element 1.
      This makes some algorithms simpler
      and much faster. Implemented by Matthew Lewis.</li>
<li>
      When searching for an include file specified with a relative 
      (i.e. not absolute) file path, Euphoria will check first for 
      a file relative to the location of the current source file.  
      If not found, then the usual rules will apply, i.e. it will
      check relative to the main program file, then check the EUINC
      directories (if any), and finally euphoria\include.
      Suggested by C.K. Lester and, in various forms, 
      by several other people. Implemented by C.K. Lester. 
      Checked in by Matt Lewis.</li>
<li>
      **ex int.ex** (in euphoria\source) will now work, since the 
      interpreter now supports machine_proc(65,...) which passes IL to 
      the fast C-coded back-end. You can also run
      int.ex with exw or exu.
      This lets you easily modify the front end and get a modified 
      Euphoria interpreter, for all platforms, that runs programs 
      at full speed (much faster than the Euphoria-coded execute.e). You might 
      also bind int.ex to get a single executable file for whatever
      platform you like.</li>
li>
      If the user does not supply a filename with an extension,
      Euphoria will attempt to open the file first with the standard
      extension for its respective platform, but if it does not find it, it
      will also look for files with the standard extensions for the other
      platforms. Implemented by Matthew Lewis.</li>
<li>
     **Translator: **
      The limit on the number of additional .c files 
      that can be created per Euphoria file has been raised from 36 to 
      well over 1000.</li>
</ul>


=== New Documentation
<ul>
<li>
      The "storage cache" compression technique that's used for bound 
      executables and .il files, was documented in comments added to 
      compress.e. 
      It reduces the size of the IL by 30% or more, while allowing
      fast decompression.</li>
     
<li>
      A documentation file, tasks.doc, was added to euphoria\demo\langwar.
      It describes the multiple tasks used in Language War.</li>
</ul>


=== Bug Fixes
<ul>
<li>
     **<font color="#009999">bug fixed: </font>**
     **Translator: **
      Translated code for routine_id() 
        erroneously returned -1 when a global symbol was looked up which
        matched a symbol in the same file as the call to routine_id(),
        as well as a global symbol in another earlier file. It was treated 
        incorrectly as a multiply-defined symbol that was lacking a 
        namespace qualifier. Thanks to Daniel Kluss.</li>
<li>
     **<font color="#009999">bug fixed: </font>**
     **Translator: **
      In rare situations, a naming conflict could 
        occur when more than one .c file is created for a Euphoria file. 
        Thanks to DB James.</li>
        
<li>
     **<font color="#009999">bug fixed: </font>**
     **Translator:** 
     get_key(), when translated/compiled 
     with Borland or LCC, required an extra keystroke after a carriage return. 
     Implemented by Jacques Deschenes.</li>

<li>
     **<font color="#009999">bug fixed: </font>**
     **Source Code Portability:**
       euphoria.h: CLK_TCK is now defined as CLOCKS_PER_SEC
       if not defined previously in the source. Implemented by Matt Lewis.</li>
  
<li>
     **<font color="#009999">bug fixed: </font>**
      **Installer:**
      Double-quotes were added around several filenames used in the
      INNO installer script (though this did not seem to affect many people).</li>

</ul>
