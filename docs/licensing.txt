== Licensing

This product is free and open source, and has benefited from the contributions
of many people. You have complete royalty-free rights to distribute any
Euphoria programs that you develop. You are also free to distribute the 
interpreter, backend and even translator. You can ##shroud## or ##bind## 
your program and distribute the resulting files royalty-free.

You may incorporate any Euphoria source files from this package into your
program, either "as is" or with your modifications. (You will probably need at
least a few of the standard ##euphoria\include## files  in any large program).

We would appreciate it if you told people that your program was developed using
Euphoria, and gave them the address: [[http://www.openeuphoria.org/]] of our
Web page, but we do not require any such acknowledgment.

Icon files, such as ##euphoria.ico## in ##euphoria\bin##, may be distributed
with or without your changes.

The high-speed version of the Euphoria Interpreter back-end is written in ANSI
C, and can be compiled with many different C compilers. The complete source
code is in ##euphoria\source##, along with ##execute.e##, the alternate,
Euphoria-coded back-end. The generous [[:Euphoria License|Open source License]]
allows both personal and commercial use, and unlike many other open source
licenses, your changes do not have to be made open source.

Some additional 3rd-party legal restrictions might apply when you use the
[[:Euphoria To C Translator]].
