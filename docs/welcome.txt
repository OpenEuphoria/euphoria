== Quick Overview

Welcome to the Euphoria programming language!

Euphoria is a programming language with the following advantages over
conventional languages:

; Euphoric
: A remarkably simple, flexible, powerful language definition that is easy to
   learn and use.
; Dynamic
: Variables grow or shrink without the programmer having to worry about
   allocating and freeing chunks of memory.  Objects of any size can be assigned
   to an element of a Euphoria sequence (array).
; Fast
: A high-performance, state-of-the-art interpreter that's significantly faster
   than  conventional interpreters such as Perl and Python.
; Compiles
: An optimizing [[:Euphoria To C Translator]], that can boost your speed
even further, often by a factor of 2x to 5x versus the already-fast
interpreter.
; Safe
: Extensive run-time checking for: out-of-bounds
subscripts, uninitialized variables, bad parameter values for library
routines, illegal value assigned to a variable and many more. There are
no mysterious machine exceptions{{{--}}}you will always get a full English
description of any problem that occurs with  your program at run-time,
along with a call-stack trace-back and a dump of all of your variable
values. Programs can be debugged quickly, easily and  more thoroughly.
; High level
: Features of the underlying hardware are completely
hidden. Programs are not aware of word-lengths, underlying bit-level
representation of values, byte-order etc.
; Debugger
: A full-screen source debugger and an execution profiler are included.
; Editor
: A full-screen, multi-file editor is also included.
On a color monitor, the editor displays
Euphoria programs in multiple colors, to highlight comments, reserved
words, built-in functions, strings, and level of nesting of brackets.
It optionally performs auto-completion of statements, saving you typing
effort and reducing syntax errors. This editor is written in Euphoria,
and the source code is provided to you without restrictions. You are
free to modify it, add features, and redistribute it as you wish.
; Multi-platform
: Euphoria programs run under Windows, Linux, OS/X, FreeBSD, NetBSD, OpenBSD
and can be easily ported to any platform supporting GCC.
; Stand-alone
: You can make a single, stand-alone executable
file from your program.
; Generic
: Euphoria routines are naturally
generic. The example program below shows a  single routine that will
sort any type of data{{{--}}}integers, floating-point numbers, strings etc.
Euphoria is not an "object-oriented" language, yet it achieves many of
the benefits of these languages in a much simpler way.
; Free
: Euphoria is completely free and open source.

Euphoria has come a long way since v1.0 was released in July 1993 by **R**apid
**D**eployment **S**oftware (//RDS//).
There are now enthusiastic users around the world.

== Introduction
:<<LEVELTOC level=2 depth=4>>

=== Yet Another Programming Language?

Euphoria is a very high-level programming language. It is unique among a
crowd of conventional languages.

=== Great Features

* Open source
* Free for personal and commercial use
* Produces royalty-free, stand-alone, programs
* Multi-platform {{{--}}} //Windows//, //OS X//, //Linux//, //FreeBSD//,
  //OpenBSD//, //NetBSD//, ...
* Provides a choice of multi-platform GUI toolkits: IUP, GTK, wxWindows
* Syntax colored profiling, debugging and tracing of code
* Dynamic memory allocation and efficient garbage collection
* Interfacing to existing C libraries and databases
* Well-documented, lots of example source-code, and an enthusiastic forum
* Edit and run convenience

=== Euphoria is unique

What makes Euphoria unique is a design that uses just two basic data-types {{{--}}}
 //atom// and //sequence//, and two 'helper' data-types {{{--}}} //object// and
 //integer//.

* An **atom** is single numeric value (either an integer or floating point)
* A **sequence** is a list of zero or more //objects//.
* An **object** is a //variant// type in that it can hold an atom or a sequence.
* An **integer** is just a special form of atom that can only hold integers. You
can use the integer type for a performance advantage in situations where
floating point values are not required.

What follows from this design are some advantages over conventional languages:

* The language syntax is smaller {{{--}}} and thus easier to learn
* The language syntax is consistent {{{--}}} and thus easier to program
* Routines are more generic {{{--}}} a routine used for strings may also be
applied to any data structure
* A higher level view of programming {{{--}}} because sequences encompass
conventional lists, arrays, tables, tuples, ..., and all other
data-structures.
* Sequences are dynamic {{{--}}} you may create and destroy at will {{{--}}} and
modify them to any size and complexity
* It supports both //static// data typing and //dynamic// data typing.

=== Beyond Elegance Sequences

* Euphoria programs are considerably faster than conventional interpreted
languages {{{--}}} Euphoria makes a better website server
* Euphoria programs can be translated then compiled as C programs {{{--}}} fast
programs become even faster
* Euphoria lets you write multi-tasking programs {{{--}}} independent of the
platform you are using
* Euphoria has a coherent design {{{--}}} Euphoria programmers enjoy programming
in Euphoria

=== As a first programming language

* Easy to learn, easy to program
* No limits as to what you can program
* Euphoria programming skills will enhance learning other languages

=== But, my favorite language is...

You will find that Euphoria programmers are also knowledgeable in other
languages. I find that the more tools you have (saws and hammers, or programming
languages) the richer you are. Picking the correct tool is part of the art of
programming. It will remain true that some people can program better in their
favorite language rather than an arguably superior language.

Give Euphoria a try, and discover why it has enthusiastic supporters.

=== Products

The //Euphoria// **Interpreter** is used to execute your code directly with no
binding or compilation steps. Edit, run, edit, run.

The //Euphoria// **Binder** is used to create stand-alone programs by "binding" the
Euphoria interpreter onto your source code.

The //Euphoria// **Translator** converts Euphoria-source into C-source. This
allows Euphoria programs to be compiled by a standard C compiler to make even
faster stand-alone programs.

You can freely distribute the Euphoria interpreter, and any other files
contained in this package, in whole or in part, so anyone can run a Euphoria
program that you have developed. You are completely free to distribute any
Euphoria programs that you write.

=== Requirements

To run the //Windows// version of Euphoria, you need any Windows 95 or any later
32-bit version of Windows.  It runs fine on XP, Vista, and Windows 7.

To run the //Unix// version of Euphoria you need a supported //Unix// platform
(Linux, FreeBSD, NetBSD or OpenBSD) and GCC v4.x. Binary packages are available
for various platforms and distributions which remove the need for GCC to be
present.

To run the //OS X// version of Euphoria, you need an Intel based Mac.

=== Conventions used in the manual

Euphoria has multiple interpreters, the main one being ##eui##.

* On //Windows// platforms you have two choices. If you run ##eui## then a console
window is created. If you run ##euiw## then no console is created, making
it suitable for GUI applications.

The manual will only reference ##eui## in examples and instructions; the
reader is left to choose the correct interpreter.

Euphoria runs on many platforms. When operating system specific issues must be 
described you will see these descriptions:

* //"Windows"// is a general reference to operating systems from Microsoft. 
!! lines above run off right side of page 
You will see the constant ##WINDOWS## used for //Windows// specific code.

* //"Unix"// is a general reference to the family operating systems that
includes Linux, FreeBSD, NetBSD, OpenBSD, Mac OS X, ... You will see the
constant ##UNIX## used for Unix specific code.

Directory names in //Windows// use ##\## separators, while //Unix// systems use ##/##.
//Unix// users should substitute ##/## when they examine sample code.
Hint: //Windows// users can now use ##/## in directory names.

Operating system names are often trademarks. There is no intent to infringe on 
their owner's rights.
Within a paragraph, Euphoria keywords (like ##atom## or ##while##) and program 
excerpts are written in a ##fixed font##. 

Samples of Euphoria programs will be syntax colored using a fixed font:
<eucode>
for i=1 to 10 do
  ? i
end for
-- this is a comment line
-- above is a 'for loop' example
</eucode>
