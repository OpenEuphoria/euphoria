Description: Intrepreted and compiled programming language
 Euphoria is a simple, flexible, and easy-to-learn programming 
 language. It lets you quickly and easily develop programs for 
 Windows, Linux, OSX and FreeBSD. Euphoria was first released 
 in 1993. Since then Rapid Deployment Software has been steadily 
 improving it with the help of a growing number of enthusiastic users. 
 Although Euphoria provides subscript checking, uninitialized variable 
 checking and numerous other run-time checks, it is extremely fast. 
 People use it to develop Windows GUI programs and Linux/FreeBSD 
 X Windows programs. It is also very useful for CGI 
 (Web-based) programming.
